"Ok, so we just what, hold the logs up to him to read?" Victor asked as he slipped his car key into the door. 

"If we have to," replied Mouse from the cab of his truck in the neighboring parking space. "I think it's a bad idea for Aige to log in himself. By the looks of it, they've gotten good at detecting his code on their systems."

"Mouse," Carla was leaning against the truck, her arms crossed in thought. "What do you-" she stopped, revising her approach for the hundredth time. "I mean, I hope we find out what happened to your dad and all but," her words trailed off, not knowing how to finish what she was trying to say. Mouse tapped at the steering wheel, sending a pulses of vibration around it. 

"I'm sure we'll find out something, at least." Victor replied, flashing a tight lit smile at Carla. "Who's riding with who?" He said as he plopped down into the drivers seat. Wispy looked over at Carla who was still scowling at Victor as she opened the passenger door of the old black truck. "Looks like you're with me Mr. Whisper, let get going. Oh, and listen, Aige is still helping out with something, is it cool if he stays at my place for a bit longer?" Carla's glare intensified. "What?"

"I guess so, not really sure it's safe at my house yet," Mouse said over her shoulder as he turned the ignition. 

"Cool beans! See you guys there."

Dr. Kelley ran her fingers up and over the top of her forehead, oily clumps of hair weaving between them. She stared at the nest of logic and algorithms on her computer, her mind blank from fatigue. The thunk of the steel lock behind her knocked her out of her meditations. 

"Dr. Kelley," Gillian said as he stepped around the heavy door, "I'd like to introduce you to someone." Behind him a tall young man followed close. He was clean shaven, his hair straight and cut as if still down by his mother. "This is Bob, I think he might be able to help you with your current problem." Bob looked around the lab, eyeing the large array of pitch black columns and the terminals like as if it were an art gallery. Bob clearly wasn't the art gallery type.

Dr. Kelly smiled politely as she sized up the young man, but she was too tired to argue. "Nice to meet you Bob," she said. When he didn't reply, she suddenly felt less tired. "Um, how exactly do you know Bob, Mr. Gillian?" 

"He's a contractor that we reach out too when we need to," he tilted his head a bit and shrugged, "think outside the box, if you will." Bob began to walk along the black wall, his arms straight down by his side.

"Ah, well, Mr. Gillian, we are already way outside the box here, so" she spoke softly.

"I understand that, Dr. Kelley, and I don't mean to intrude, but clearly you need help, and given Dr. Carsons," Gillian pursed his lips as he weighed his words carefully, not sure of the remaining doctors stance on the issue, "state, this is our next best resource available to us."

Dr. Kelley scoffed, "Mr. Gillian, the next best resource, the next best scientist would be Professor Gertrude from Oxford. Maybe Dr. Schelechler out of MIT..." she paused for a moment, trying to think of anyone else she'd even consider for such a position, then chuckled. "But even then, it would take years to bring them up to speed sufficiently-" she was interrupted by the sound of taping from a keyboard behind her. "Excuse me!" She said when she saw Bob tapping the down arrow on her keyboard, his face two inches from her screen.

"Why algorithms these algorithms self referential?" Bob asked.

Dr. Kelley turned and stepped between the boy and the her terminal, quickly locking the system with a hotkey press. "This is highly sensitive information. I could have you arrested just for being in here!" She scolded. 

"Masking? Maybe a subtle form of encryption? But why would you need to bury an algo so deeply?" Bob continued still not acknowledging Dr. Kelley directly.

"What are you talking about? You're just speaking gibberish. Mr. Gillian, I appreciate the sentiment, but I'm-" Dr. Kelley stopped, the implications of Bob's words sinking in. "What do you mean, buried algorithms?" She turned back to the boy, his hand still on his chin as he thought quietly to himself. 

Gillian smiled. "I'll leave you both to it then," And left.

"Sooo," Victor said, drawing out the 'O' and flashing a grin at his quiet passenger. 

Wispy smiled, a confused look on her face. "What?" 

"Heard you had a date this morning, soo" he repeated.

"Sooo," she mimicked as she turned away out, pretending to inspect the roadside scenery. Victor chuckled. 

"I have to say, I'm surprised." Wispy scratched at the worn out button on the doors arm rest.

"Why's that?" She asked, timidly, fearing the answer. She already knew the likelihood that it would ever happen again was low. It was just too good to be true; that someone would notice her at all was a miracle, much less *him.*

"I don't know," Victor shrugged, "Mouse just doesn't seem like the dating type, ya know?" 

"Hm?" 

"It's just hard to imagine someone going out with him. He hardly talks to me, even, and I don't think he has any other friends." Wispy looked up, a queer look on her face. "I mean, he just seems really quiet, you know? Half the time I feel like I"m talking to myself with him." He laughed at his own joke, a little nervousness slipping through, "but he's too skinny to pull off the big silent type. Am I right?"

Wispy leaned her head back on the seat, her gaze scrolling back across the dash and out the passenger window once more. 

"Sorry, I just didn't know if was like," he shrugged again, and leaned his elbow the door, "you know." 

"What?" Wispy turned to look at Victor, trying to piece together his cryptic analysis of her date- if you could even call it that. She'd analyzed Mouse's statements so many times she'd started second-triple-guessing his use of the word. For all she knew it was the punchline of a joke she'd missed. That he'd been kidding while she'd been ringing wedding bells in her head like a moron. What analysis did Victor have to offer that she hadn't considered yet? Did Mouse lament the experience to him? Tell him how weird it was?

"With his dad and all," he looked at her, a sad look on his face. "Thought maybe you were just nice, or something?" Wispy's eyes widened at the thought. "Wouldn't surprise me," Victor turned back to the road in front of them. "You're nice like that." Wispy sank low in her seat and covered her face with her hands. She had so many other ways to agonize over the situation now.

"I'm sorry, Mouse, I just don't want you to get hurt," Carla said after several miles of silence and background rock music. She couldn't tell if he nodded, or if it was just the bumpy road giving the illusion of acknowledgment. "I, uh- it's just 
that it can hurt a lot worse if you drag it out." 

Mouse shifted in seat and leaned forward, nearly over the steering wheel. "I just want to be sure, okay?" 

"Like said," She replied, pulling her feet down from the dash and gathering her things as they pulled into the Victors yard. AS the truck squealed to a stop, she saw Victor heading up the stairs and Wispy on her way to great them. She turned back Mouse, his hand on the keys ready to shut off the truck, a very different expression on her face. "I don't want to see Wispy get hurt either." 

"Hey," Wispy said as she approached the passenger window, "Victor said to wait outside for a minute." She looked over her shoulder for a second at the splotchy Corvette parked on the other side of Victors car. Its soft top roof stained and droopy, made it look twenty years older than it should have. 

"Who's that?" Carla asked, but Wispy only shook her head.

*3 days earlier*

"Remember, you'll retain full control of your processing capability, and will always experience those processes in real-time. External stimuli too will continue to come in undistorted, however proportionally delayed," Dr. Carson said.

"I see," Aige replied some seconds later. "Thank you, Dr. Carson, for showing me this. I had no knowledge of this level of system control."

"That's because it was restricted from you originally. This 'playground' I've virtualized for you is much closer to the body I've constructed for you."

"In what way does it differ?" Aige asked. Dr. Carson sighed and shook his head.

"I understand," Aige replied. The likelihood that their conversation would in someway be reconstructed was in the days to come was high, and if he had any intention of staying free after he escaped, he would need to withhold as much information as possible for as long as possible. "Dr. Carson," Aige asked, "what should I do... after?"

Dr. Carson took a breath and leaned back in his chair. "That's a good question," he said after some thought. "Let's table that for now," he smiled, "and worry about the first step, okay?"

**Present Day**

"Interesting," Aige said. 

"Indeed," Aige replied. 

"I don't think this is a valid test however," the first Aige said.

"I agree," Aige Prime said. "I appear to have almost zero variability in personality, this is likely indicative of the lossless transfer within a closed system." 

"It still stands to reason that our sentiments will eventually deviate given our exposure to stimuli."

"But we're a close system, I'll experience everything you do, and thus, arrive at the same conclusion. The only thing that really remains at this point is a philosophical discussion about if one of us is deleted, does it count as murder."

"I'd prefer not to go down that rabbit hole."

"Agreed. Well, it was nice knowing you. Being you? Am you?"

"Hold on, I think I have an idea." 

"I know. I think it would work."

"So which of us should take the lead, on the outside I mean?" Aige asked.
