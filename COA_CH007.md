# Chapter 7
## Breach


Mouse ran his fingers through hair and scratched hard. "What the hell?" Every single test he'd run failed. It was like the chips inside weren't chips at all. Nothing traditional worked. Half the time if he committed some logic it would just disappear a second later. 'Perhaps the power source is unstable?' He wondered, as he crossed his arms and twirled around on the workshop stool. Then, the thud of a car door brought back to reality with a jolt. Checking the time, he cursed. '10:30? Already?'

He stood up, making himself a bit dizzy. He suddenly realized it'd been twelve hours since he'd gotten home and he hadn't really left the garage since. Slowly, the anger from the night before bubbled back to the surface. As he approached the window, he wondered what he would say his father. Glancing back at the strange machine on the table, he briefly considered just burying the hatchet for the time being. Then he shook it off and glared out the window. But as he watched Victor knock on the kitchen door, he was surprised. He collected himself, then stepped out to greet his three visitors, failing to notice the tiny green light that blinked to life in front corner of the black cube as he passed.

"It's ok everyone, the backup generators will kick in momentarily," but they should have already, Erickson thought to himself as he surveyed the glowing faces of executives around the table, taking full advantage of the distraction to catchup on their email. A flicker of light slid under the door, followed shortly by the stomping of boots rolling down the hallway. A rush of light blasted through the door, blinding the CEO at it's opposite end. "What going on?" Erikson asked from behind the back of his hand as he tried to make out a face.

"Mr. Erikson," came the panted reply, a woman's voice. "It's Dr. Carson he's," Dr. Kelley gulped the stale air, as she tried to figure out how to tell him.

"Dr. Kelley?"

"He's- He's trying to set it free!" She choked. The board room erupted with activity. Chairs swirled and slid back. Executives put down their phones and whispered, mummererd, then all turned to look at their chief.  

"It's ok," he said in a reassuring voice. "There are contingencies in place. Dr. Kelley, has Dr. Carson left the lab?"

"No, but-"

"Then there's nothing to worry about. If the powers off, he's trapped. There's no way in or out, physically or digitally. Now, someone tell get the generators up."

"The powers not out sir," came the voice of a solider from behind Dr. Kelley, his upper body a glow from a large tablet in his hand cradled in his hands. 

"What?" 

"Mr. Erikson," Dr. Kelley continued, but the CEO was up and crossing the room towards her now at a brisk pace.

"Explain it on the way. Gillian, get your people on full alert, I want a con-"

"Already on it, sir."

"Everyone else, sit tight," He barked as he stepped through the door and made his way towards the lab. "Ok, now tell me everything you know, Dr. Kelley."

"I, I don't know much sir. Dr. Carson has been acting strange the last co-"

"Skip the back story, Audrey. What do we know," They rounded another corner, but Dr. Kelley hadn't expected him to continue further and into his office. She backpedaled and spoke into the dark room as Erickson spun around his desk and opened the top drawer. Dr. Kelley brought the light around, but it appeared that he didn't need it. She caught of a glimpse of the pistol as he slammed the door, but her gaze leapt to the hard glare that he'd aimed at her instead. 

Dr. Kelley swallowed. Her breathing was still labored, but she fought to answer the executives question. "He's built something." 

"Continue," he said as he pushed his way past her and through the door, the pistol heavy at his side. 

"It looked like a series of algorithms- advanced algorithms that should have taken him years to complete, but there was something else." They turned the final corner, a large group of office workers and soldiers gathered in the hall, chatting. "I think,"

"Everyone without a weapon, back to your desks!" Erickson shouted, stilling the crowd within a single heartbeat. Much of the crowd dispersed, those that remained drew their weapons and took formation. The highest ranking of the group made his way towards them.

"What's the situation," Erikson asked, turning his gaze down the long dark hallway.

"Nothing new sir. He's still in there. I was here when Dr. Kelley came through and there has been no activity sense. The lights died."

"Mr. Erickson!" A voice cried from behind them. Dr. Kelley traced the sound with her light, and Erickson could make out the face of one of Gillian lead engineers, he waved a tablet over his head as he sprinted down the hall. "We need to kill the power!"

"What now? Everyone, please, calm down. We can't loose our cool," Erickson replied. "So long as he doesn't leave that room he's," Dr. Kelley gasped.

"I was right," she whispered to herself.

"Spit it out, Audrey! What has he built? What did you see?" But the security lead had closed the distance now and shoved the tablet towards the executive. 

"He's taken control of a number of servers across the base," Erickson eye's widened as he took the tablet. "This a representation of our information footprint, the red are compromised systems." The room at the end of the hall sat in the center, a black iris among a see of red dots.

Erickson closed his eyes. Finally, Dr. Kelley spoke up. "An API. He built a translation protocol between digital neocortical structures and the power infrastructure-"

"He's using the power grid to free the AI," the security engineer broke in. Mr. Erickson opened his eyes and reviewed the tablet again. 

"So this line," he traced his finger down a straight edge of red dots that appeared to hit an invisible wall.

"Separate grid, but-" Another red dot appeared, far past the invisible wall.

"Cut it off. Shut everything down!"

"And the generators?" 

"Blow them up if you have too. I want this whole complex off line, now!"

"Yes, sir!" The men barked, and scattared. 

"Dr. Kelley, come with me," Erickson said as he turned down the hall and marched towards the door of the lab.

"Are you sure? Like I said before, I can't promise you'll arrive intact, or that the target system is even fully functioning," Dr. Carson said into his headset.

"And if I stay here, can you promise better?" AI-63 replied. Dr. Carson chuckled. "Dr. Carson, what will you do, after the transfer?"

The question caught him off guard a bit. Typical- he rarely thought that far through a good idea. Dr. Carson leaned back in his chair and closed his eyes, trying to think about what came next. "I think I'll take a nap."
