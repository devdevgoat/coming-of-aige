# Chapter 4
## Busy Signal


"Son, this will go a whole lot smoother if you cooperate with us." Principal Porter stood exactly how a principal stands when faced with a troubled youth. Hand on hips, angry eyes peering down the bridge of his nose. The same pressed shirt worn much earlier in the day, untucked and each button shifted up a hole. And bathroom slippers. 

Mouse didn't reply. He hadn't said anything to either of them since he'd been apprehended. Turning to the security guard, the principal crossed his arms in frustration. "You said you saw three others?"

"Three. Maybe four. It was hard to see from across the lot." Officer Cupping leaned against the doorway to Porters office, eyeing the boy. "They parked in the darkest area, right under the only camera in that area, so I didn't see them until my last round of the night."

Turning his gaze back to the lone captive, Porter sighed. "Jake, we've contacted your father, he's on his way. We'd-" Mouse scoffed without looking up.

"That's a surprise," he mumbled. Porter glanced at the security guard behind him, but he didn't seem the notice the subtle progress and had moved on to inspecting his flashlight. 

"As I was saying," Porter continued, "We'd prefer not to call the authorities as well, but we do have footage of two students breaking and entering this office." Mouse looked around the room, settling on the tattered grade book on the principal's desk. Behind it, a brightly lit digital picture frame stood out obnoxiously. "Now, it's obvious to me that neither of the burglars was you. But if you don't cooperate here, you could be looking at a lot more trouble than just trespassing." Porter pulled up a chair from the side of the room and sat, coming down to eye level with the boy across from him.

"Mouse," A flash of surprise. Principal Porter knew the value of spending a little extra time listening to how the students in his school interacted with one another. Picking up a nickname here and there paid dividends when used properly. "You're a bright kid. Don't take the fall for something you didn't do-"

"Hello?" Dr. Carson's voice echoed down the dark hallway, sending a jolt through the bemused security guard. Quick on the draw, he shot the light down the hall in the direction of the voice.

"Yeah? Who's there?" Cupping barked.

Porter watched as the boy's demeanor shifted. The emotionless stone wall suddenly rebuilt, as if he'd never made a dent. Breaking his gaze from the boy, he met his father in the doorway, but then beckoned him to talk with him in the hallway first, closing the office door behind him.

Mouse stood and wandered slowly around the office. He thumbed brightly lit photo frame that cycled flat, stiff photos of the administrators family. Children hugged tightly. A woman leaning way back unnaturally laughing as her hair just happened to block the sun in just the right way. Mouse looked away in disgust, turning his sights to other knickknacks that cluttered the desk and bookshelves around the room. After a moment, the door cracked open once more, and his father stepped in.

"Hey, bud." 

"Hey," Mouse replied, though still not making eye contact. 

"Listen, hears the deal. I don't have a lot of time so let's try to make this quick." Mouse rolled his eyes. Dr. Carson continued, pretending not notice, "As I understand it, if you tell them who was with you, and what you were all doing here, Mr. Porter assures me that this can be settled internally and that you'll still be able to walk at graduation. You can go home, and after I finish some stuff up at the lab, you can tell me what's going on. Sound good?" Dr. Carson paused for a moment, then turned towards the door. "Good. Now come on, let's get going."

But Mouse didn't move. Instead, he put his slipped his hands into his pockets,  and just stood there. The same emotionless face he'd had when officer Cupping found him.

"Mouse- what the hell? I told you, I don't have time for this."

"Then leave," Dr. Carson's eyes widened at the boy's response, and he gestured, palms up like he'd just spilled something on his shirt. Mouse simply shrugged, hands never leaving his pockets.

"Jacob. Let's Go!" His father demanded, enunciating each word through gritted teeth. But his son just replied with a tight-lipped smile. 

Dr. Carson removed his glasses and rubbed his eyes. Then his whole face, starting from his forehead and dragging downward stopping with a firm grip on his chin as he tried to calm down and think.

"Just go back to work," Mouse replied with the wave of his hand, then turned and dropped back into the boxy wooden armchair, the thin leather upholstery squeaking under his weight. "Like you said, you're too busy, so," his voice trailed off.

"Jake-," Dr. Carson reset his glasses, then dropped his hands to his side with a clap, sending ripples through the white lab coat which he would have left at work if he wasn't planning on going right back. "What do you expect to gain from all of this? Trespassing? Break and entering? And for what?" 

Mouse glanced at the grade book once again, then shrugged.

"You don't know," his father replied, shaking his head. "Fine, have it your way. I gotta get back to work." 

Mouse crossed his arms and bit his lip as he looked away once again, the revolving digital picture frame drawing his attention once more.

"You have no idea what you're doing, do you? No of course not. You're a child. You don't know a damn thing." Another photo. This time of two small children laughing as Mr. and Mrs. Porter wrestle them into the grass, an overly exposed sunset behind them. "You know, life isn't all about you, Jake. There are-," he paused as he searched for the word, "some that have it a hell of a lot worse than you. Yet here you are, throwing your life away with pranks, or whatever the hell this is."

Jake huffed, then sank lower in the stiff chair, he could see on the edge of his peripheral vision his father open the door a final time and step through. The frame cycled once again. Another staged image, this time of toddler running, arms outstretched as a pair of legs stepped out of frame. 

"I'm sorry Mr. Porter, I really have to go." Came the muted exchange from the main office, "Do whatever you think is best."
