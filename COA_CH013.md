"That son of a- I'm texting him right now!" Carla said, sneering overtime she looked at Wispy's empty nightstand and the yellow sheet bundled on the floor in front of it.

"No, wait," Mouse interrupted, his blocking Carla's view of her phone. "I don't want a single electronic hint of what we're doing."

"Stop being so paranoid, I'm just going to text Victor, call him a stupid piece of shit, and ask very politely where the hell he went with our AI." She yanked the phone out from under Mouse's protective shield.

"I'm serious, don't mention anything about Aige!" 

"Fine!" Wispy, taking advantage of the disagreement, hurried about, trying to slyly put things away and triple checking that no stray papers, or worse, doodles laid about. "Hey Mr. Whisper, " Carla interjected, startling her. "He didn't say anything to you did he, about where he might have taken him?"

Wispy shook her head. Carla sighed. "Ugh, guess we'll just have to go to his place then," Carla turned to Mouse, who had made his way to the window and was staring out at the street. "Ready the you are." But he didn't turn around. "Uh, Mouse? You ok?"

"Huh? Yeah, fine. Ok- let's get going then," as he turned, he stumbled over a small wire, the power cord to a floor lamp that stood less than a foot from the power outlet. It was if the sight of the cord alone tripped him. Carla stepped forward as if to catch him, then looked at Wispy who also seemed to notice.

"Mouse, when's the last time you slept?" 

"Huh? I don't know," but his speech was slow. With all the excitement, Carla didn't notice it before, but now it was obvious. 

"Mouse, have you slept at all since we got caught at school." 

"I'm fine, we need to go. I have to talk to- whatever his name is." He brushed her aside and headed towards the door.

"Mouse!" She barked. He turned, and it was if someone had removed the last veil hiding the last 72 hours. Tears drained from his eyes like overfilled sponges, and his chin bobbed as he tried to speak. Wispy stepped forward, a hand outstretched, but it was as if she never moved it all, compared to blur that was Carla. She hugged at his neck, then his chest, then both, as if trying to stop the bleeding of his soul, rather than a particular part of his body. Wispy clutched her hands close to her chest, her own tears starting to fall.

As he laid down, Wispy pulled the pink wool covers free from under the corners of the mattress while Carla tucked him in. She then rushed across the room and closed her curtains, blocking the late afternoon sun out. Carla turned off the light on Wispy's bedside table, and they both made their way stealthily towards the door, the bundled yellow sheet on the floor eliciting a sneer from Carla as she kicked it aside.

Outside the door, Carla pulled out her phone again and waved for Wispy to follow her down the stairs. Half way down, Wispy heard the hollow ring of Carla's speaker phone, then Victors voice.

"Hey girl," he said

"Hey- Vickwad- what the actual hell were you thinking?" She replied, sending a jolt through Wispy as they transitioned from stealth mode to full frontal assault. 

"Chill. Out, Carla!" Victor shot back, "I needed help with something and Aige offered. Plus, aren't Wispy's parents coming back soon? Don't you think they'll have some questions about a giant ominous talking box when they see it?"

"Tsk," Carla bit at her cheek, "Whatever. We'll talk about it more tomorrow. Mouse doesn't want us drawing any attention to him, so keep him at your house for now, but I swear to god Victor-"  

"Jeez, calm down. Why are you so worked up over this?" Carla and Wispy looked at each over the cell phone between them. "Hello?" Wispy shook her head.

"Mouse said we should talk about it in person. See you in class?"

"Yep."

"Uhhhgargg!" Carla bellowed, nearly crushing her phone as she hung up. "Why are boys so stupid?" She collapsed onto the recliner and looked around the room. Not a single object was out of place. The TV, though large, looked almost normal from this far away. Wispy sat uncomfortably on the white leather couch diagonal from her. Carla sighed. "I'm sorry hun, I'm stressing you out aren't I? Hows your sisters procedure going?"

"She's good. The procedure was yesterday, actually. She's just recovering today. My mom texted me, said she's been asking for me." She flashed a weak smile.

"Awe, that's sweet. She must love her Sissy!" 

"Yeah," Wispy leaned over on the soft armrest, her hands sandwiched between her knees, but her eyes seemed distant. 

"Anything I can do?" Wispy shook her head. Carla looked up the wooden stairs that arched around to the balcony above, the top of Wispy's bedroom door barely visible from this angle. Carla shot a sly grin at Wispy, "You sure you're ok with a *boy* staying the night in your room?" 

The realization pulled at Wispy's face like an overly tight hair bow, and her cheeks began to boil. *He* was going to stay the night? At *her* house? In *her* bed? She sunk further into the leather sofa. Carla guffawed, relishing in her terror. 

"Well, I'll leave you two to it then!" She said, still chuckling as she clamored out of the oversize chair. Wispy's head spun and she tried to hide the shock on her lips wither her hands. 

"You? You're leaving?" She said, trembling.

"Yeah, I have to cook tonight. Dad hasn't been driving much so money's a little tight. And when he cooks my clothes smell like burnt grease for three days, so..." She leaned down and gave Wispy a hug. "I hope you're sister's ok," she said as she squeezed, then she pulled back and placed her hands on her shoulders. "And Wispy, I have something very important to tell you. I should have told you sooner, but- well we've been busy."

Wispy gulped, her eyes still wide, her hands still shaking over her chest.

"Always," she paused. "Aways use protection!" Carla burst out in laughter as she scampered off. 

Wispy didn't move. She barely breathed for what felt like hours.  Eventually, she decided she needed to eat.

Gillian scrolled through the transcript on his tablet, Erickson walking next to him down the bustling hall acting as his eyes while the security executive leaned close to the screen. "It's not a very creative code word, 'leet' speak I believe it's called?" Erickson said as he navigated the pair around a corner and into his office.

"I don't think it's code sir, I think it's a nickname," Gillian replied. Erickson dropped down in his chair and leaned on his desk. With a batt of his hand in the air, Gillian shut the door. Satisfied that they were alone, Erickson rubbed at his eyes. "Maybe you should take a break, sir." 

Erickson snorted. "Any update from Dr. Kelley?"

"Not good. She said she at a lost. She needs help." Ericson leaned back in his chair, his head leaning even further over the top as he stared at the ceiling. 

"I'll put some feelers out."

"George," Gillian said, "At this stage, I think we might need to take a less traditional approach."

"What do you mean?"

"Well, in the security world we sometimes have to go outside the traditional talent pools in order to crack a tough nut. After all, if the solution was available in some textbook, we wouldn't have a problem would we?" 

"Can't say I know anyone directly, did you have someone in mind." 

"I'll reach out, see if any of my usual contractors are available. I have some budget left, but," Erickson waived off the comment.

"Teddy we are so far past working about budget constraints at this point... This will be Sieve Co's make or break moment. We'r e going all in. Just fix it." Gillian nodded, then lifted his tablet back to his nose and made his way out into the chaos of the hallway.

The parlor door, it's hinges recently oiled, swung closed behind him with a thud, causing Mouse to wince and pause. Listening carefully, he heard the sound of leather creak.

"Mouse?" Wispy croaked, flipping on the small lamp next to the sofa. Mouse turned and reopened the door and leaned in. 

"Hey, Wispy. I'm headed out. Thanks for letting get use your room, sorry about that."

"What time is it?" 

"About three. Good night," he said, waving his hand as he slipped out. Wispy rubbed her eyes and began collecting her bedding, then remembered.

"Oh, hey-" But Mouse was already headed back.

"Guess Carla borrowed my truck then?"

"Yeah, sorry. I can take you home if you want? I have the keys to my dads car," Mouse looked around the large room, and the girl wrapped in a quilt at the base of the stairs.

"Um,"

"Or," she was tired, and part of her wondered if she was dreaming when she said it, "we could get something to eat?" Mouse chuckled, then nodded. 

"Huddle House?" 

"Um," now she knew she was dreaming. "Waffle House, maybe?" Mouse smiled, and small, possibly asleep girl dashed up the stairs to change.

"Grits or hasbrowns?

"Hashbrowns, please." 

"Coming right up." The waitress turned and barked a cryptic message to the cook, leaving the two to their hushed conversation. 

"Ok, but say- say the do find him, what do you think they'd do?" Wispy asked as she rolled the paper sheathing from her straw into tiny balls under her the cusps of her sleaves. 

"He made it sound like they'd erase him," Mouse replied. He shifted in his seat and leaned back. "A big thing about AI is this idea of 'singularity." Wispy eyes narrowed, trying to recall the word.

"Like, a black hole?"

"No, I mean those have one too, but this is very different. It's used to describe the point when an AI becomes so intelligent that it can improve itself. That improvement spawns additional cycles of improvement. So on and so forth."

"Ok, but why is that a bad thing?"

Mouse shrugged. "I don't know, the biggest fear as that with each cycle, and there would be an infinite number of cycles, the intelligence would become more intelligent than any human ever could. Leaving us in the dust. Like ants." Wispy brow furrowed further as she tried to understand. Bits of paper straw falling apart between her fingers.

"So they want to delete Aige because he'll become smarter than us?" Mouse sighed, leaning forward again and hugging his coffee. 

"They want to delete Aige because... well, when's the last time you put any weight in what ant thought about?" Wispy nodded. "But I don't know. My dad didn't seem to think that was the case. Otherwise he wouldn't have created him and helped him escape, right?" Wispy winced, then recovered.

She wasn't sure if he was right or not, but she was sure what happened when you accused someone of being in denial. "What's he like? Your dad?"

Mouse tapped the side of the thick porcelain mug, like a developer might do while trying to decide what to do next. That was it. She'd gone too far, her feet slid back under the bench, her sleeves grew an inch longer. "I'm sorry, we don't-"

"He hasn't been around much lately." She relaxed again, a little. Mouse scoffed, and made a twitching motion with his head as if to indicate the jam had something to do with it, "guess I know why now. But before then, before my mom left, he was always  playing games with me." 

"Like, card games?"

"Sometimes. But not like go-fish or anything," he smiled a bit, a memory tapping on his shoulder. "One of the earliest memories I have is staying up late one night in my bed playing 'concentration.' I think I was five or six? You lay all the cards in a normal deck upside down in rows. Then you take turns flipping two over. If they match, you keep them and go again. The winner has the most cards at the end. It was simple, and required a lot of concentration-no less- for a five year old."

"Sounds fun," 

"I loved it. Anyway he played with me over and over again until I got good enough to beat him. Then, we'd play a new game. I remember spending months trying to beat him at chess when I was nine. I even taught my friends to play at school so I could practice more. I could play three or four of them at once with out much effort, and I still couldn't beat him."

"Wow," Wispy said softly. 

"Hmpf, don't forget these were nine year olds. I could never beat him though." Mouse leaned back in seat while several plates of food were sat down in front of them. "Could I get some ketchup? Thanks."

"That's kind of mean. Never?"

"Nope. Not even once. We'd play other things too, and he'd always have a neat little brain teaser in his desk at home for me, but there was one rule that permeated through all of our games, no matter what."

"What was that?"

"You always figure it out for yourself. No cheating."

"But," cut at her waffle with her fork, "isn't hacking like cheating?" Mouse chuckled. 

"Depends on how you look at it I guess. In my house, it would be cheating if I asked the guy who built it how to get in. Everything else is fair game. Well, short of stealing a I guess." He laughed. Wispy smiled as she took a bite and tried to commit the whole morning to memory.

"What about you? What's your house like?" Wispy swallowed, thought felt like a chew too soon. A sip of water later, she'd recovered, but her gaze went back to her plate quickly.

"Fine." 

"But your sister? That's," she sat her fork down put her hands in her lap. 

"Yeah. I don't know... I don't really want to..."

"Oh," Mouse said, then started pecking at his food with his fork. "I'm sorry, I'm not really good at these."

"What do you mean?" Wispy asked, looked back up.

He shrugged, "I don't know," he looked around the empty yellow diner, at the windows that reflected more of them than the empty parking lot outside, at the cooks that leaned against their grills on their phones, and at the waitress that doodled in her ticket book, then back at the nervous girl in front of him the first time, "first dates, I guess?"

Then, at 4 am in a tiny orange diner, two phones and a ticket book hit the floor at the sudden sound of the worlds tiniest heart attack.
