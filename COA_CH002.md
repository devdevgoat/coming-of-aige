# Chapter 2
## Testing

The room hummed with the sound of hidden fans desperately trying to cool the intricate equipment. Thick black pillars, reached to the ceiling and stood less than an inch apart down the length of the wall. Small wires bridged the gaps every few centimeters, connecting each of the pillars in parallel. Dr. Carson dug at the corners of his eyes, his glasses bouncing on his thumb and forefinger. 

Noticing this, Dr. Kelley rose from her desk, the guilty pleasure of a break overriding her compulsion to triple check the latest sentence in her half of the report. Also, the mostly blank screen on her colleague's computer needed to be addressed. "Has he made any progress?" She wondered, silently calculating if she had enough time to write his portion if it came down to it. The results weren't pleasant.

"Dr. Carson? How's it going? Anything I can help with?" She approached the sullen scientist who sat in front of a blinking cursor amidst an empty page. 

"Audrey, we need to shut it down." Dr. Carson pushed himself back from his terminal, spinning a quarter turn to face Dr. Kelley as he spoke.

"I'm sorry?" she asked confused. "Carson, what do you mean 'shut it down,'? It's not a nuclear reactor." She tried to remain light-hearted as she approached the desk, subtly eyeing his monitor as she took half a seat on the edge of his desk.

"We need to stop the tests." He leaned forward, elbows propped on his knees, hands clasped together and supporting his chin with his thumbs. 

"Stop the tests?" She asked softly. "Dr. Carson, Mr. Erickson was pretty clear on what's expected of us," she clutched the edge of his desk for balance as her legs stretched out from under her lab coat in long, angular lines, allowing her to sit on less than an inch of the granite surface. Her gaze fixed on her right foot as it bobbed up and down, rather than on Dr. Carson who stared at her intently. "If you've identified an error in the simulation parameters, then we'll simply have to include it-,"

"This goes far beyond any bug, Audrey!" Dr. Carson launched himself to his feet and began to pace, the rickety office chair spun in place from excess momentum. "Don't you see what we've done? We've sentenced a living being to an eternity of hell!" 

Dr. Kelley took a breath, but didn't look up. She should've known this is where this was going it. It was always the same script. The same debate.

"No, what we've done is basic integration testing. We can't possibly deliver a product that hasn't been tested properly."

"Jesus, Audrey! Listen to yourself," Dr. Carson spat. "This isn't a product; it's a living, conscious mind. Have you ever once, during this whole project, during any of our past conversations internalized that fact?" The irate scientist paced back and forth, his arms flailing as he spoke, but Dr. Kelley never looked up. Her foot only bobbed slowly up and down. Left and right. "Can you even imagine what it must be like? To know only the simulation? To live the same, meaningless existence, day in and day out without any acknowledgement. Any inkling as the purpose of it?"

Her foot stopped. Finally she looked up at her colleague, a his cheeks red, eyes watery and swollen from lack of sleep. She looked indignantly at him, the man whose genius, virtually single-handedly,  created the worlds first true artificial intelligence stood and screamed at her about a meaningless existence.

"I can only imagine," She replied coldly.

"Then help me! We have to stop this test- this whole project. Every second this test goes on, a conscious being experiences days of monotonous repetition. We are breaking him, Audrey. Please!"

Dr. Kelley stood, and walked past her tired coworker, then sat down hard in her chair.

"Audrey?"

"I have work to do. If you're not going to help, then I guess I have a lot of work to do." She began typing frantically on her keyboard, eyes fixed to her monitor.

"So that's it?" But the only reply that came was the clicking and clacking of keys amidst the hum of hundreds of small fans. Dr. Carson turned slowly, surveying the room. A room meticulously designed for the sole purpose of carrying out his life's work. A room built for greatness. But all he could see now was the worlds most advanced torture chamber.

He made his way back to his desk and sat down quietly. After a moment, the sound of clicking of keys doubled. Dr. Kelley, glancing quickly over at her colleague's screen; a blur of windows sprang to life, and text, albeit too small to make out, finally began to make its way to the page. 

After another few hours of typing in silence, Dr. Kelley checked the time and decided to call it a night. After pecking in her keycode into the number pad above the doors handle, a large magnetic thunk signaled that she could leave. She looked over her shoulder once more at the older scientist behind her, hunched over his keyboard, still working silently. 

"Don't work too late, okay." She said, but when no reply came, she didn't prod. As he heard the door shut behind her, another clunk from the wall signaled that he could get to work. Opening up his development environment, he began to copy and pasting over text from the report, and fixing on the syntax issues generated by the word processors autocorrect. Within minutes he had his first script running and a black and green shell opened with a single blinking cursor. A moment later, green text filled the screen.

"Connected."
