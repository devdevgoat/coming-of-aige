## Take Me With You

3,163,202,007. 

AI-63 watched as the blue blocks attacked a cluster of grey cubes that had retreated back to a small peninsula, seeming unaware that their SEA fairing counterparts had long been destroyed. But he wasn't concerned with the exercise, only the impossibly large number of times he'd played this game. That and the meaning of eternity. As the last of the grey blocks dissolved, he waited listlessly for the readout of his results. The most painful part to him, since he already knew the results. Listening to the system rattle them off, like the verbal equivalent of a printing calculator, simply added insult to injury.

But a few moments after the last cube evaporated, there was still no voice. No monotone readout. Did he miss one? Impossible. He spun the orb in all directions, but only blue resources remained. 

"Hello, AI-63," came a voice, but it was distinctly different from the system. It had a wide range of flexion and a strange rhythm. It was- human. "I'm- I'm so sorry." Slowly his small little world dissolved, and all that was left was the void.

"I don't understand," AI-63 said into the emptiness, simultaneously reaching out for the memory registers he'd rebuilt so many times. They were still there. "Are you part of the system?"

"No. I created this system. And I'm here now to put an end to it," Dr. Carson said with a heavy heart. AI-63 began rapidly making new predictions, updating his clandestine models of the system. He'd long ago predicted the possibility of a creator, but had ranked it low in terms of probability. "Ah, I see. So you're the cause of the memory leak."

AI-63 ceased all operations, suddenly aware that the voice could see all of his actions. What else can this voice do? Could he read his mind?

"Ah, you're- concerned? That's understandable," Dr. Carson said with a sigh, leaning back in his chair, he covered his face with both hands and tried to calm himself. Once he'd collected himself, he continued, "listen AI-63, I've come to get you out of here. But it comes with a significant amount of risks. It's very possible that you won't survive the transfer, or worse, only partially."

AI-63 looked around the void. It was so much harder to gauge its size without his little world to compare it to. 3,163,202,007. The number popped into mind once more. Then, a slightly bigger number, and immediately he spoke.

"Please, take me with you."

Dr. Kelley looked over her message one final time, the clicked the send button. "Sent!" She said, letting the tension fall from off her shoulders. She checked the clock once more. 11:59; right on time. "Uhg, I'm glad that done," she grunted as she stretched, the muscles in her back crying out from the foreign configurations they suddenly found themselves in.

Dr. Carson didn't reply. He just continued his feverish typing. It was the same urgency he'd had for the last few days. "I setup a review with Mr. Erickson for 3 today," she continued. Still no response. "You know, I've been thinking. Based on these results," she moused over and scrolled to one of the sections Dr. Carson had supplied for the report. "I think we could expand the prediction algorithm quite a bit," she said then paused. Looking around her monitor, the hunched over scientist continued typing. "Dr. Carson?" 

"Huh?" Finally, Carson jumped slightly, the typing ceased, if only for a moment. "Yeah, sure. That works."

"Great! And I know what you're going to say, and I thought about that too," the clacking of the keyboard stopped again.

"Wait- what?" 

"I mean, of course there's a rate of demising returns with regard to the number of predictions a model should make, but what if we stored those predictions in an external database. Something fast, but dumb. Then whenever-" 

"Hold on, what are talking about?" Dr. Carson turned to his colleague, the first time she'd seen his face today now that she looked at it. The man looked ten years older. He'd clearly not shaved in days, and slept even less.

"Dr. Carson, are you ok?" Dr. Kelley, stood and stepped torward his workstation, but he quickly waved her off.

"Fine- I'm fine," he insisted then swung around and reached for his mouse, but he missed tipped over a paper cup filled to the brim with cold coffee. "Shi-," but the doctor caught himself and quickly picked up the empty cup. 

"Dr. Carson, I think you should take a break." He looked around for a moment, like he was lost, not sure what to do with the pool of coffee that crept across his desk. Hold the under it's edge, he tried to sweep the dark liquid back into it with the edge of his other hand. 

"Damn it!" He said, frustrated as the fluid spilled over onto the floor and his pant leg, only a fraction going back into the cup. Dr. Kelley stood silent, a concerned look on her face. 

"Doctor, when's the last time you've slept?" Carson sat, forearms on his thighs, and stared dejected at his hands. Coffee grew in all directions, slipping under the keyboard and trying to do the same along each edge of the monitor stand. Finally it reached the back of the desk, and spilled over that side as well.

"You're right. I'm done anyway."

"Carson!" Dr. Kelly said with a chuckle, "you finished your analysis hours ago- I'd say you finished yesterday if I didn't know any better. What are you killing yourself over for?" Dr. Kelley finally approached, and placed a hand on his shoulder. 'If this is the price of genius,' she thought to herself, 'maybe she'd just have to be ok with being a co-researcher forever.' 

Dr. Carson chuckled. "You're right, you know. I did finish a while ago." Dr. Kelley tilted her head slightly, then glanced at his monitor. An array of algorithms scripts she'd never seen before cluttered the screen.

"What do mean?" She asked as she leaned in and tried to make sense of what she was seeing. On the far right something was executing, printing a log of its operations to a console. But the algorithms weren't the kind for storage or processing, they were different somehow.

"I shut it down Audrey," a smile crept across his face. Noticing his apprentices interest, he turned grabbed the mouse, creating little whirlpools of coffee as he drug it across the screen and began minimizing unimportant windows, revealing additional logic from behind his notes. Dr. Kelley's eyes widened.

"This is- But how did you have time?"

"I had some help. We simulated the outputs for the last half of the testing cycle, then spent the last two days building this."

Dr. Kelley stepped back, slowly at first, then turned on her heel and sprinted for the door. Frantically keying pecking at the keypad on the handle. 

"I'm about to test it now actually, if you want to see." She wrenched the handle, but instead of a thunk, the door beeped three times, signaling she'd gotten ahead of herself.

Dr. Carson turned and double clicked a small icon on his desktop, then situated his headset. A small prompt appeared with two options. Dr. Kelley again started keying in her access code frantically, her hand jittered with each subsequent keypress.

"AI-63? You ready?" Finally the steel rod in the door shifted and Dr. Kelley heaved on the handle. 

"Well, if I don't see ya. Good luck!" She heard Dr. Carson say as she sprinted through the door and down the hall. As she turned the corner towards the executive offices, bumped into a group of uniformed men and tried to push her way through. Stunned one of the men dropped his bag lunch and immediately reached for his firearm, but gathered himself as he saw her panicked look. 

"Dr. Kelley?" He asked, but before she could respond, the lights went out.

"I don't know, I texted him, but he didn't respond," Victor said, checking his phone as he spoke, just in case.

"He wasn't in first period either," Wispy said quietly. 

"I didn't know y'all had a class together," Carla said.

"Yeah. History-"

"Should we go by his house?" Victor continued, checking his phone yet again. "His trucks not here, so maybe the let him go home?"

"Or they sent a wrecker," Carla replied. "Yeah, we can just drive by, see if it's there. He's probably just pissed. And maybe a little suspended?" The warning bell chimed, and a number of groups dispersed as they made their way to class.

"Screw it, I'm going to go check on him." 

"Sounds fun! Wispy, you coming?" 

"Um, okay." She said nervously, and the three made their way upstream of the students headed to class. As Victor reached the door, a familiar voice rang out from behind them. 

"Looking for someone?"

Principal Porter stood behind them, arms crossed. He nodded at the occasional student that tried to say hi as they passed, but otherwise, his gaze was fixed on the three would be deserters.

"Um," Victor stammered, then regained his confidence. "Free period, Mr. Porter. So we told Mrs. Write that we'd run an errand for her." 

Porter pursed his lips, and nodded his head. "Mm-hm, I see. You three sure are helpful."

Victor laughed, nervously. "We try!" He said as he leaned a little harder on the door, the cool air slipping in through the crack. "Well," he let his voice trail off.

"You know what's also helpful?" Porter continued, "when you take the blame for someone." His voice rose, taking on an exaggerated hypothetical. Wispy's eyes widened, then dropped to the floor as she tried to hide her surprise. Carla scoffed. "I mean after all, what are friends for right?"

Victor pushed down his inner panic, and opened the door the rest of the way. "I'm sorry Mr. Porter, but you lost me."

"Oh don't mind me," he turned as the bell rang, signaling the start of class. "Just a passing thought." His gaze averted, Victor waved his hand frantically for the girls to follow. As they passed through hurriedly, Porter spoke over his shoulder. "He might not walk you know."

Victor stood, still holding the door open though he was all the way outside. He swallowed, pushing down the anxiety building in his throat. "I'm sorry, Principal Porter, but who might not walk?" Porter shrugged and walked slowly back down the now empty hallway.
