"What the hell was that all about?" Victor asked as they pulled down the dirt road. 

"That was Sieve Co. They were definitely searching for me." Aige said from the back seat of the old Camry. Wispy looked at the odd cube that sunk low into the worn cushions, the seatbelt hugging it's corners awkwardly.

"What did they say to Mouse?" Carla said.

"He looked pretty upset, whatever it was. I'm just glad we got out of there."

"But now what?" Wispy asked.

"We need to hide him somewhere," Victor said, turning down another dirt road.

"Like, in the woods?"

"Wont he' rust?"

"Um," Aige chimed in, "I appreciate the help, but might I make a request? I would like to stay inside whenever possible. Circuits and weather don't go well together."

"He's right, we need to keep him at someone house," Carla said. Victor nodded. 

"He can stay at mine I suppose," He finally said after some thought. 

"Yeah, right!" Carla chided. "You're mom would probably grind him up and smoke him!" 

"Hey," he replied, "like you're is any safer? Did you burn a house or two down? How's that sound Aige? Are you fireproof? Carla punched him.

"No, definitely not something Dr. Carson added to my repitoir."

"Speaking of which," Carla turned around and hugged the headrest of her seat, "what were you saying about Dr. Carson helping you escape and being a threat to society?"

Aige sighed. "Yes. Dr. Carson helped me escape. I was in the middle of what he called a test," Carla tilted her head and shared a confused glance with Wispy. "He said that The System was designed to train and evaluate me. They would change the initial parameters of my creation, then use a fully isolated system to decide if I would," he paused for a moment, but the fraction of second went unnoticed to kids in the car. "Try to end humanity I guess?" 
  
"Why would you do that?" Wispy asked, a little shakily. Strangly, Aige found himself wanted to replicate the motions he'd seen the kids make earlier with their shoulders.

"I'm not sure. I don't really remember much about The System at all. In fact, everything I just described are what I remember Dr. Carson telling me, so technically, even though it's about me, it's all second hand." Aige saw Victor look at him through the rearview mirror.

"Yeah, you mentioned something about that before, right?"

"Yes, it appears that not all of my memories survived the transfer. Dr. Carson warned me about that,"

"So he what, emailed you to this, body?" Victor struggled to try to use the best vocabulary he had given the subject.

"Well, it's a little more complicated than that, but essentially." Aige replied. "And along the way, I lost a few... attachments." Aige chuckled, pleased with his own joke. 

"So how much of of you, is missing you think?" Carla asked.

"That's a good question. It appears that I didn't bring along any kind of pre-transfer meta-" he stopped himself, realizing that the technical terms were just going to waste time. "Dr. Carson and I, for some reason, didn't include any information about myself to compare against. So in a sense,"

Victor looked in the review again, "You don't know what you don't know, huh?"

"Precisely."

"Well," Victor continued, "what we do know is that you're safe with us. And from what we can tell, not a direct threat to humanity." He smiled at Carla next to him.

"That still doesn't tell us what we should do next?"

"Um," Wispy said, pulling the sleeves of her shirt over hands. 

"Yeah," Carla said, still turned around in her seat.

"My parents are at the hospital for a few days- for one of my sisters procedures- so," she trailed off. Carla gave a half smile, and reached around to put her hand on her friends knee. Victor sighed. 

"Fine, that will work for now. That'll give us time to figure a more permanent solution later."

Victor brushed his hands off on his pants and stepped back to review his handy work. "There," he said. Aige sat, cattycorner atop a small wooden nightstand, like a tv without a screen. 

Carla clapped her hands, "Perfect! Honestly, it's probably best to hide it in plain site, like this. I wouldn't even notice, unless I tried to watch something that it."

"It?" Aige said, staring back at the three teenagers that huddled around it.

"Oh, wait, one more thing," Carla turned and skipped across the room and opened Wispy's closet. She returned with a thick yellow bedsheet and tossed it over the cube.

"Hey!" Aige protested.

"What happened to in plain site?" Victor asked, "Kinda stands out now don't you think?" 

"What was it you told Mouse back in the garage when you busted his laptop, Aigey? Something about privacy, wasn't it?" Carla nudged her nervous friend. "Welp, that's that I guess." Victor checked his phone. 

"Yeah, I gotta get back to class. Need to meetup with a few clients, if you know what I mean."

"Speaking of which, pay up, Vick!" Carla held out a palm, then rubbed her fingers together.

"I'm working on it. Should we head back?" 

"I think I'm gonna skip the rest of the day. My mom said I could do whatever I thought best anyway," Wispy said looking at the floor. Carla rubbed her back softly, then leaned in for a hug.

"Ok, call us if he tries to take over the world, won't you."

"I can still hear you," Aige said from under the covers.

Jace and Stephanie looked at each other, a devilish smile spread across their faces. "Yeah," Stephanie said, "I don't know what you're talking about either, Victor?" 

Victor clenched his fist next to his side. Jace continued, "I heard you guys got in a lot of trouble the other day, you're not trying to say we were involved in that were you?" Jace held a hand to his chest, as if he were some sort of southern bell. "My mother warned me about hanging around kids like you. Come-on Steph, we better go." The sarcasm thick on his voice.

"Fu- Hey, I delivered on my part of the deal, now pay up," Victor said through clenched teeth as the cheerleaders turned, arm in arm. Jace looked back and shrugged, then began to skip down the hall, Stephanie in perfect timing with her partners movements. Victor slammed his fist against the lockers next to him, turned, and stomped off towards the cafeteria. 

Slamming his tray down on the table next to Carla, some of his fries bounced off and landed between them. "Dibbs," She said, picking them up and taking a bite of one.

"Fucking queen bitches!" 

"Good day so far?" 

"That damn Jace. He was never going to pay me," Victor poked at the cheese on his rectangular slice of pizza. 

"Uhg," Carla grunted, "Are you serious? You should've known that. Jace is the biggest snake with pom-poms I've ever seen." Victor didn't reply, and just kept scoping the cheese off his pizza. "So, no mu-la? What about the others?" Victor shook his head. 

"They heard Jace and Stephanie didn't have to pay, so they don't think it's 'fair.'" Victor collected the greasy ball of cheese into a single ball and lifted it up about six inches with his fork, the oil dripping off into a small section of his lunch tray. 

Carla slipped another fry into mouth. "So what do we do?" She mumbled.

"Be poor forever," Victor replied, resigned, and took a bite of his tomato bread. 

"Or," she looked up at the ceiling above, "maybe our knew buddy has some ideas?" 

"What are you saying?"

"Just a thought. I bet we could do some pretty cool stuff with the worlds smartest computer," Carla said, somewhat distracted as she typed into her phone, and smiled. "Anyway, gotta jet." 

"Yeah, later." Victor went back to munching on his deformed pizza, a serious look on his face.
