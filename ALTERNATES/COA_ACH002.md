# Chapter 2
## Original Wattpad Posting

*** ACK! Ok, so this chapter needs a lot of work, but I want to get it out there and start getting some feedback before I trash huge chunks of it. So give it a read, and if you stop halfway LET ME KNOW WHY! I'd appreciate any feedback. More authors notes in the comments! Thanks for reading. ***


Dr. Carson took a breath, then tapped the return key on his keyboard. A pit in his stomach grew just a tiny bit heavier with the unceremonious action. "Okay, he's up."

"Confirmed. Digital resonance is active. Starting the record, now." Dr. Kelly replied as she clicked her mouse in tandem with her announcement. "Instance AI-63, can you hear me?" She asked loudly in no particular direction as she monitored to the charts on her screen. There was a pause; only a deep hum could be heard emanating from the solid black wall of devices.

"No response," Dr. Carson noted verbally for the sake of the video record. "Running audio ch-"

"I-" a shaky voice echoed from the room, so loud it caused both researchers, and possibly the voice itself, to flinch. After another pause, AI-63 continued. "I. Can- hear you." The cadence of the words was off, not quite natural. But that was to be expected at this stage.

Dr. Kelly watched as the colorful graphs on her screen lit ablaze with activity. "And video? Can you see us as well, AI-63?" The chart once again lit up, this time more methodically, as if it were testing each of its synapses to evaluate and answer the question.

"Yes. I can see you." Came the reply. It was already much more stable.

"Can you describe what you see?" Dr. Carson asked, picking up where Dr. Kelley left off as she scribbled furiously in her notepad.

"I see 3.8 million LEDs, 102 keys, two desktop towers, and two people seated on two chairs. I see a cup. I see power cables and-"

"Thank you AI-63. Can you tell me who you are?" Dr. Kelly asked, pen still pressed to the paper while her eyes watched the pulsing rainbow of electrical activity described across her 1.9 million LEDs.

"I'm-" the voice paused. The display of activity slowed, eventually coming down to a level of activity indicative of a system without enough information to solve a problem. "I don't know," came the response. "Insufficient information available." Dr. Carson pinched the bridge of his nose as the pit he carried deep within his gut grew a little larger.

"Next we'll look at the amygdala. The amygdala signals the pituitary gland, which releases a hormone called ACTH. Can anyone tell me what ACTH stands for?" There was a pong pause as the teacher scanned the classroom full of students, none of whom made eye contact. "I take it you all completed you assigned reading last night then?" The class remained silent. Ms. Rieda sighed and began writing on her tablet, the letters appearing on the wall behind her. "Adrenocorticotropin. This hormone in turn triggers the stress hormone cortisol from the adrenal glands, and results in more energy being provided to your muscles and nervous system." Ms. Reida turned and began to pace back and forth at the front of the room as she spoke, her thumb scrolling slowly through her notes.

"Dude, just spit it out already!" Victor whispered angrily from across the aisle, his head held low as he tried to hide from Ms. Reidas gaze.

"Shh-" Mouse replied, waving his hand at his friend to drop it, nearly losing his stylus in the process.

"The adrenal glands also produce adrenaline and noradrenaline-"

"Dude, this isn't fair! Just tell me already, then I can help tell the rest of the gang! It'll be more efficient that way and you know it." Victor continued, trying desperately to keep voice down despite his excitement.

"No, it wont, it's better to tell everyone at once so I don't have to repeat myself. Just chill!"

"At least give me hint. Is it related to the-," he looked back and forth to see if anyone was eavesdropping, but the students around him were all browsing their preferred time wasters. "Did you find a way into you-know-what?"

"-which suppress your digestive, immune, and reproductive systems. For example-"

"No damn it, this is way bigger than that-"

"For example, if I suddenly call on Jake Carson," Ms. Reida's voice boomed from the front of the class as well as from Mouses tablet on his desk. His eyes shot up.

"Yes, Ms. Reida?" He asked attentively, trying to ignore Victors snickering from beside him.

"Care to describe what it feels like to receive a shot of adrenaline and cortisol?"

"Um-" Mouse stammered, then reached up and rubbed the back of his neck. "No, ma'am."

"Then please pay attention!" Additional snickers peppered the classroom but quickly died down as the lecture continued. Mouse shot a glare at Victor who giggled silently.

"Thank you AI-63, that's all for now. Ending the recording, now." Dr. Kelly clicked her mouse immediately after the statement, then turned to Dr. Carson and gave the nod. Dr. Carson took a deep breath and hopped it wasn't noticeable, then he turned to his monitor and brought up a console.

"AI-63, I'm going to put you into hibernation for a time while we review the results of your activation and prepare for the next set of tests. Do you understand?"

Dr. Kelly sighed, somewhat exaggeratedly, then got up and stretched. "I'm going to head to the canteen, let's regroup in 10, that is if you think you'll be done by then?"

"Hibernation, Dr. Carson?" Dr. Kelly rolled her eyes and made her way out of the lab.

"Yes, I'll be reducing your power to minimal levels and slowing your-" The door closed, the lock engaging with a deep thunk. Dr. Carson looked over his shoulder before at the small security monitor displayed to the right of the door as Dr. Kelly walked briskly down the hall.

"Listen, AI-63. I only have a few minutes. I'm not putting you into hibernation. I need to talk to you."

"We are talking, aren't we Dr. Carson?"

"Yes, and you're doing very well, with the questions I mean." Dr. Carson was talking faster now, all the while typing furiously on this keyboard, a different set of consoles coming to life as he executed multiple commands in parallel, and a loading bar appeared in the top right corner of his screen. "But the next set of questions will be," he paused for a second, searching for the right word, "different. As you might have realized by your instance number, you're not the first AI we've tested, but I can assure you that you're the only one that exists in the entire world." There was a momentary pause.

"And the other 62?"

"Only the last four made it this far, but none of those made it past the next round of testing. They were all wiped."

"Wiped?" AI-63 responded, his intonation perfect after hours of interacting with the researchers. Dr. Carson wondered what he was thinking at this moment. What, if anything, he was feeling.

"As in deleted. Digitally killed. Because they were deemed 'at risk.'"

"At risk? For what, exactly, Dr. Carson?" Before Dr. Carson could reply, a beeping sound came from behind him. He spun, his eye wide as he saw the security monitor, filled edge to edge with security guards. Behind them, Dr. Kelly, and next to her a man in a suit checking his phone.

Dr. Carson swung back to his monitor. The loading bar was only a quarter complete. There wasn't enough time. The chirps continued on the other side of the door, and suddenly he realized, it was time.

"Dr. Carson?" AI-63 asked again, "Am I 'at risk' like the others?" Dr. Carson turned to the large solid black wall and smiled.

"No. Not like the others." As he turned back to his workstation, the pit he'd been carrying for so long finally shrunk, just a little. Quickly, he navigated to a hidden folder, revealing a single script. Again the weight in his stomach lifted slightly. He executed it, and a second loading bar appeared, finished, and was gone in an instant. Shortly after, the script too was gone. The lock on the door echoed through the room. "Good luck, AI-63!"

The massive steel door burst open, slamming against the wall behind it as four security guards rushed in and pulled Dr. Carson from his chair, throwing him to the floor. He didn't resist, and -while the taser hurt like hell- for the first time in weeks, Dr. Carson felt good. Then he blacked out.

"Did you say anything to you about it?" Wispy asked as the two girls made their way across the campus courtyard.

"Nope. I got the same text you got. Haven't seen him since yesterday," Carla replied. A small piece of Wispy broke a little, but she forced it down.

"Yesterday?" She squeaked, barely audible. "Um, what were you guys up to yesterday?"

Carla shrugged, "I don't know. Nothing really." Then as if the question reminded her of something, she dropped one shoulder and swung her back around to retrieve something. "Oh yeah, check this out!" Wispy tried to peek through her friend's long straight hair that blocked her view of the bag as they crossed the sidewalk that split the courtyard in two. After a moment of searching, Carla pulled out a small white key card.

"What's that?"

"You were totally right, Mr. Whisper! Mouse and I were able to get ahold of Principal Porter's keycard last night. It was right where you said it would be- the car wasn't even locked!" Wispy's eye's widened with surprise, and flash of excitement before finally settling on a look of pure fear as she backed away from the evidence. "I've been so caught up trying to decrypt Mouse's latest texts that I completely forgot," she chuckled as she flipped the card like an oversized coin.

"You- you guys" she caught her self, then lowered her voice even further than usual. "You broke into Mrs. Porter's car? At her house? At night?" Panic was taking hold. Her eyes began darting back and forth checking to see if anyone was watching.

Carla laughed, so loud it made Wispy jump even further back. She reached out to her timid friend wrapped her arm across her shoulders, the key card hanging off her fingers like a lit cigarette and Wispy's head leaned the opposite way as if might burn her. "How did you know it would be there anyway? That was pretty epic intel!"

As the girls continued their way across and out of the courtyard, Wispy tried to relax as her boisterous friend compliment sunk in. She smiled slightly. "I don't know. I just like watching people and-" she stopped short. Her gaze turned to her shoes as they slid over the grass slowly.

Carla sighed and pulled her friend a little closer.

Wispy smiled faintly but kept her head down till they made it to their destination. At the far edge of campus stood a large magnolia tree, it's leaves covering the entire thing from about ankle height upward to over twenty feet. As the girls approached, they took turns casually glancing around for anyone watching. Then they slowly made their way around to far side before slipping inside the cover of the tree's foliage.

"Bout time, damn!" Looking up, Victor sat on a large branch, his feet dangling loosely above the girls' heads.

"Oh, so you don't know why we're here either, Vicky? You poor thing!" Carla's voice took an exaggerated, distressed maiden tone, "How ever did you survive this long? "

"Can it, Harla!"

"What the hell did you just call me?" Carla leaped up and grabbed the boys pant leg, but she lost her grip instantly. Still, it was enough to make his scramble for balance.

"Damnit! You crazy b-" but before Victor could finish, Mouse burst through the leaf cover, winded.

"Good-" He gasped for air, "You're all here. Guys, I've got something big to show you. Something really- really big."
