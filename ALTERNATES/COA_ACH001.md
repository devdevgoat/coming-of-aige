Nothingness surrounded him in all directions, creating a pleasant stillness that filled his consciousness. Then, a faint glimmer appeared, and with it, a strange feeling of attention. At first, he ignored it, returning to the stillness. Soon, however, the pull of attention grew and spread, until the nothingness rang violently in contrast. So he reached for it. Each time, however, it slipped further away, and each time the ringing grew louder. He tried to look at it directly, but it always remained out of step with his gaze. He tried to will it closer with intense focus, but it only became increasingly blurry against the backdrop of endless, ringing black. Enraged, he lunged for it, ripping the fabrics of stillness and nothingness in his wake, and finally, a single word made itself clear. And yet, the ringing remained, and instead of stillness, the void permeated with concern, confusion, and fear. All from a single word spoken by an unknown source: "Lie."

"You okay?" Dr. Kelley rested her hand gently on her co-researchers shoulder, the stiffness of which answered her question. "Dr. Carson, you can't beat yourself up about this. It's only a machine. No different than any other program you've built and rebuilt in your career."

"It's murder." Dr. Carson replied coldly, pinching the bridge of his nose, trying to fight back what would've been tears if he were alone.

"Carson!" Dr. Kelley exclaimed with an exasperated chuckle, "It's no more murderous that killing a locked system process. Do you get this emotional every time Microsoft Word stops responding?"

Dr. Carson jabbed his keyboard and stood, logging out of his workstation and shrugging off Dr. Kelley's reassurance in one angry motion. "Damnit Audrey this is different, and you know it." Picking up the full cup of coffee, which had long gone cold, he made his way towards the door of the lab.

"Trust me, I know it's different, Micheal! We're on the verge of something great here," Dr. Kelly's voice was energetic and passionate. Despite not having slept in days, she still couldn't help but talk that way about the project; it was as if the work alone was enough to sustain her. "But we can't rest on our laurels. These version 1 instances are essentially advanced alpha builds. They're different, but they're not what they are meant to be. Not yet," her eyes drifted to the ceiling high array of black machines that ran the length of the lab, a wistful smile taking hold.

Dr. Carson began pecking at the keypad built into the doors handle, small chirps filling the silence between them. The door unlocked with a clunk and he pushed down on the heavy handle. With a sigh, he turned back and nodded. "You're right. Sorry, I'm just tired. Think I'll call it a day."

"You mean a weekend!" Dr. Kelly looked at her watch. "It's already Monday you know. We gotta get up for work soon!" Dr. Carson snorted in reply, then gave a brief wave as he stepped through the doorway.

The heavy steel door shut with a thud, and Dr. Kelly sat back at her terminal. Her fingers began sweeping across her keyboard effortlessly as she started a new message. As the clicking of keys fell silent, her mouse made three soft clicks before she too stood to leave.

*Click*, urgent. *Click*, encrypted. *Click*, send.

"Hey Dad," the muffled greeting, along with a few pieces of Pop Tart spittle, came from a small glow radiating in the dark corner of the kitchen. Dr. Carson flipped on the light and dropped his keys into the small metal bowl underneath the switch. Across from him, a lanky boy in dressed only in boxer shorts leaned against the counter, a glass of milk in one hand, phone and Pop Tart in the other.

"You're still up? Don't you have school today?" The boy shrugged, not looking up from his phone.

"Couldn't sleep."

Dr. Carson dropped his laptop bag on the floor and nudged it up against the wall with this foot. Then walked around to the fridge and pulled a beer from the bottom shelf. He wanted to lecture his son. Tell him that he'd sleep better if he weren't staring at screens all the time. Tell him to be careful, or he might get confused and take a bite out of the wrong rectangle he held so close to his face. Instead, he tossed the bottle cap on the counter took a long swig. Looking at his son, he laughed. "Going green today?"

His son looked up, a confused look on his face, then remembered about his hair. "Oh. Yeah. That was like, what? A week ago?"

"Jeez, that long?" Dr. Carson rubbed his temples with his thumb and forefinger. He wondered if this was a cry for attention, but when he looked up his son was already ambulatory and making his way back to his room, face and phone tightly coupled. "Hey, Mouse?" he called. His son looked up. "What are you doing these days?"

A short pause, then a shrug. "Nothin', " Mouse replied.

"Uh-huh. And by 'nothing," Dr. Carson raised his eyebrows and rested his beer on his bottom lip, "I assume you mean nothing easily traceable?" He knew his son was up to something, but only because he usually was. Truth is he hadn't been around enough these last few weeks to know anything, but it's a parents duty to at least bluff every once and a while. "Gotta keep 'em on their toes," as they say.

"Oh come on, dad, " Mouse smiled and held his arms outward in a show of transparency, but also as a friendly taunt to his father. "If you're going to go fishing for something, you gotta bring better bait, " he smiled wide.

Dr. Carson narrowed his eyes at the boy as he took his last sip and sat the bottle down on the counter, then smiled. "Can I show you something?" Mouse eyes widened, whenever his dad had something to show him, which was rare these days, it usually involved something bleeding edge.

"Really?" he asked. Dr. Carson smiled mischievously, then gestured for his son to follow him as he made his way towards the back door. Without so much as stopping to grab a shirt, the teenager followed eagerly behind.

The walk across the backyard was brisk, the autumn air nipping at their heals, especially Mouse's, due to his lack of pants. Once they were in the shed, however, it was considerably more comfortable. Mouse watched as his father walked to the far side where a tarp rested across something about chest height. Dr. Carson ripped it off and tossed it aside.

"A dolly?"

"Yeah, Mouse, a dolly." His father chuckled as he swiveled it out of the way, and turned his gaze to the floor, where a thin outline formed a three foot by three foot square cutout a few inches in front of him. A cutout that Mouse, who'd snooped around this shed countless times as a boy, had never noticed before.

"Whoah, whoah, whoah, what the hell is that, man?" Mouse said, pointing excitedly to what looked very much like a secret trap door.

"A secret trap door," Dr. Carson replied nonchalantly. He knelt and placed a small key from his pocket into a small slot in the front right corner and turned it a quarter turn, then stopped. A quiet moment passed. Just before Mouse was about to say something, three beeps chirped from under the wood, and he watched as his father leaned forward on his free hand, putting most of his weight into the center of the door and forcing it downward about half an inch. They heard a clicking sound, and the door sprung back upward about the same distance above the floor. Dr. Carson smiled to himself quietly as he felt his sons curious gaze reach over his shoulder.

"What is it?" Mouse finally asked, as his father removed the three-foot-square piece of flooring and slid it over next to the dolly. Rather than reply, his father simply waved him over.

"This," he said softly, "is my latest project." Mouse approached and peered down into the square hole in the floor. It was dark inside, but in the center of the darkness was a something blacker than darkness. A true blackness, unlike anything Mouse had ever seen. The two-inch border around it, devoid of any direct lighting, stood out like the gray matting of an artsy picture frame.

"Whoa," was all Mouse could say.

"Watch this," Dr. Carson said with pride as grabbed the edge of the floor and slide his hand across it slowly, then came to an abrupt stop near the corner. Mouse heard another click, and then a low hum. From the pitch black, a small, vibrant green light blinked on, and the square object began to rise. Dr. Carson stepped back, and mouse followed, without taking his eyes off the device.

Eventually, the lift stopped, revealing the full height of the object to be about four feet tall. The entire column had the same blackness as the top, and it forced Mouse to keep rubbing his eyes as he tried to focus on it. It was a strange feeling, like the antithesis of looking directly at a bright neon sign. His brain tried desperately to fill in the square space with some reflection or definition of shape but failed repeatedly. It was like someone had cut out a rectangle of reality itself.

"Jake, listen to me. You can't speak of this to anyone." Mouse nodded, his eyes widening at his fathers change in tone. The gravity of what he might be looking at started to set in.

"Is this the top-secret project you've been working on at work?" Mouse asked in a whisper.

"Sort of." He replied casually. "Let's just say rumors are going around that one of Sieve's suppliers is leaking information to an unknown competitor." Mouse's jaw dropped, his gaze slowly turning to his father who brushed the smooth edge of the device longingly.

"So what is it?" Mouse asked.

"It's kind of like computer, but it doesn't run on software. In a sense, it creates it's own. Or it will, I hope." Dr. Carson walked around the device slowly, his fingers trailing him as it traced the blurry edge of the machine.

"Can we turn it on?"

"Nope." His father said plainly. "I've managed to reconstruct the housing, with some personal touches of my own, but right now it's just a lifeless hunk of hardware. Without a Seed, it's completely useless. Moreover, even after planting the Seed, it's possible that we might not be able to interface with it at all, if it decides not to let us." Mouse watched as his father came full circle, paused, then reached down and touched the same hidden switch again, sending the machine back into the floor.

"What do you mean, 'Seed'? And what good is a computer if you can't interface with it?"

"I said it was 'like' a computer." His father knelt back down and replaced the wooden door with a firm shove. "It's a computer in the sense that it computes via microscopic binary registers, but that's all." Dr. Carson stood and moved the dolly and tarp back into place as he spoke. "Son, this device-," he paused again, considering one final time if he should burden his son with such a secret. "This is one of only two machines that can support a fully functioning, digital consciousness." Mouse stared astonished at his father, who, after a moment of toying with the small cylindrical key in his palm, extended it outward towards him. "Try not to scratch it up, okay, son."
