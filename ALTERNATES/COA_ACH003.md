# Chapter 3
## Original Wattpad Posting

***Authors note: Why, oh why is writing so hard! Somehow I've made it chapter 3, and we have yet to meet our protagonist in earnest... Maybe I need to write a Chapter 0? A prologue? Is that why books have prologues- for when the author gets this far and can't seem to fix a problem?! Gah, oh well. This chapter is much shorter. It's more of a scene, but I don't like the idea of chapter 3.1, so it's chapter 3 for now. Additional authors analysis in the comment!***

Mr. Erickson scrolled through the report on his tablet quickly, scanning only the bolded text and the occasional reference to timelines. "Tell me, Dr. Kelley," he finally said without looking up from her extensive report as it scrolled quickly across the screen in a blur. "How exactly do I convince our client that, despite our staff being reduced to a single scientist and valuable research possibly in the hands of a third party-" His voice rose as he spoke, cracking the executives usually calm demeanor. "How do I assure them that we will not deviate from schedule?" 

Dr. Kelley straightened in her chair and rose her chin. She'd prepared for this, but now she felt minutely aware of every inch of her skin as it tightened under the weight of the CEO's frustration. "I-" she stammered, but regrouped quickly. "I've reviewed the project timeline extensively sir. Dr. Carson's role was dwindling by the day." She took a breath, this was the part she wanted desperately to sound casual, ad-libbed. "To be honest, it was never exactly critical." Erickson looked up, but with his eyes only.

"Is that so?" He asked as he returned his gaze to the reports final page.

"What I mean to say is- Dr. Carson was a valuable and excellent assistant in getting the project kicked off, but at these final stages, I'm all that's required to see it to completion." She took a breath, that would have to do, for now. 

Erickson laid the tablet down in front of him, the screen going blank as he looked away and leaned back in his chair. He tapped the desk with his fingers and stared intently, practically through the scientist that sat anxiously across from him. 

The tapping continued in silence while Erickson weighed his action. Suddenly the worst case scenario seemed for a moment possible. Would he blame her for letting things go this far? Her pulse quickened, and she fought to control her breathing. Finally, an electronic chime interrupted his tapping. Erickson leaned over and pecked the three times, his expression never changing.

"Well," he finally spoke, calm once again. "It appears our client has offered to take care of our little personnel issue at least. I'll forward them your report and tell them we have nothing to worry about." Dr. Kelley relaxed her posture ever so slightly, then straightened once again.

"Doctor-," Erickson's voice now took on that of the seasoned salesman, and with it, the formality of boss-employee melted away. "Audrey, I don't need to tell you how important this project is to our client. Every day's delay will not be measured in dollars-"

"I understand, sir," Dr. Kelley's interjected, her voice steeled with confidence. "I will make sure the product is perfected on time."

Erickson smiled, then pushed himself up from his desk. "I also don't need to remind you what it will mean when you do," he extended a hand, prompting Dr. Kelley to stand in kind. "You know, history doesn't particularly care who did what when. It only matters who's left standing at the end. Audrey, I want you to be the one to cut that ribbon with those oversized scissors. Don't let me down." 

Dr. Kelley smiled proudly and nodded her head. She turned and made her way out, her smile widening further with each step.
