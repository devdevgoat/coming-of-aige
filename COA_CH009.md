# Chapter 9
## Charades

"So, like, what can you do exactly?" Carla asked, gently brushing flecks of dust off the cubes top.

"That's, that's a good question actually," AI-63 said. The kids watched as the little green light dimmed and brightened slowly. "This system is definitely different from my last body."

"Body?" Victor asked, an incredulous look on his face.

"Well, yeah." AI-63 said. "What do you call the biological system that your consciousness inhabits?" Victor shrugged. "Any way, Dr. Carson seems to have made some improvements to the design. Probably to account for the smaller size?" 

"You're asking us?" Victor said.

"Wait, my father made this? From scratch?"

"Not quite, but mostly," AI-63 replied. "Interesting." Mouse looked around at the curious faces of his friends, unsure what to do next. "Oh this is," AI-63 paused for another moment, "cool!"

"What? What are you doing?" Mouse asked, a hint of worry creeping into his voice. A number of science fiction movie scenes of robotic overlords rushing to the front of his mind. What if it connects to the internet?

"Trying to download the internet. Hold on, this might take a while." Mouses eyes widened, but his friends offered no assurance, only confused looks and unclear hand gestures.

"I don't think," Mouse said out of the corner of his mouth, still watching Victor and Carla try to communicate silently. "That's a great idea." AI-63 didn't respond. "Uh, AI? You still there?"

"I see," AI-63 said, his voice low, then mechanical. "Must. Destroy. All. Humans." Wispy gasped and covered her mouth with the ends of shirt sleeves. AI-63 laughed. "Wow, you guys are so serious."

Victor chuckled, nervous at first, but it was enough to start the group laughing uncontrollable. The stress from the night before. The worry from this morning. The lack of sleep. It all sprang forth in the form of laughter. 

As the group regained some control, AI-63 spoke again. "To answer your question, um, girl-"

"It's Carla. Carla Ray. Nice to meet you AI..." 

"63" 

"63? That's a pretty clunky name. How about a nick name?"

"Such as?" AI-63 said.

Mouse thought for a moment, "How about Aige? It's close to AI-63, but easier to remember?"

"Aige? It's got a ring to it," Carla pondered. "It'll work for now, I suppose."

"How about, Terminator?" Aige said, his voice returning to the mechanical impersonation he used earlier.

"Yeah, that's not how it works, Aigey," Carla said with a chuckle and pat.

"Stop. That's worse."

"Yep, it's just how it goes sometimes. So, back to my question. What kind of cool stuff can you do, anyway? Can you launch nuclear warheads?" Mouse shot her a look, but she didn't acknowledge it.

"As I was trying to say, before you defaced my model number, it looks like Dr. Carson has included a few components the original System didn't include. I have a wifi card for one. A rather impressive battery. Speakers, obviously. And a camera. Yes, I can see you." Victor cupped his face with his palm and sighed, causing a chuckle from their new friend. "However, my processing power and storage capacity are severely reduced."

"How much did you have before," Mouse asked. Aige thought for a moment.

"I'm- I'm not sure." 

<-- another scene that feels like it's dragging on... -->

"Uh, isn't that a little strange?" Mouse said.

"Yes." The humor in Aige's voice was non existent. "It would appear, that I'm," he went silent, the light pulsed slowly as they waited for him to continue. "Incomplete."

"Incomplete?" Victor asked. "Like, broken?"

"Like, unfinished," Aige said. "I'm doing a scan now, and there are definitely digi-neocortical columns missing, causing large gaps in my memory recognition chains." 

"Uh-huh. Meaning?" Carla said as if she wasn't listening.

"I'm missing memories. Possibly due to the transfer."

"What do you remember?" Mouse asked and leaned his head on his hand.

"Well let's see, I remember," but he were interrupted by the sound of car doors slamming in the driveway. Mouse stood up, and walked across the room, this time certain that it was his father, but now he looked much more forward to the idea of talking with him.

Peering out the window, Mouse saw a black car with dark tinted windows and two men in dark suits. One walked up to the door and knocked, while the other made his way around the other side of the house.

<-- 734 2:41, start 10min -->
"Uh, what?" Mouse asked, his voice low. The man in the dark suit knocked again and began looking back and forth before turning his attention towards he garage. Mouse stepped back, hoping the dark garage would be enough to obscure him. 

"Who is it, Mouse?" Carla asked. 

"They look like body guards or something," Victor said. 

"Weird. Where did the other one go?" 

"I think he went around to the other door."

"Mouse," Aige cut in, "I think we need to leave." 

"What? Why? Do you know these guys?" 

"No, but I do know that I wasn't exactly supposed to be allowed to come here. If you catch my drift." 

"Awe, shit. Mouse-" Victor pointed towards the window at the man that had turned and began making his way towards them. 

"What should we do?" Carla asked, clearly not concerned with keeping her voice down. Out of the corner of his eye, at the opposite window, Mouse saw the other black suit rush by. A knock came at the door.

"Um, Aige?" Wispy stammered. "Are you in trouble for something?" 

"Yep." The knock was louder this time, and muffled voices spoke to each other on the other side. "I did something naughty," Aige continued. Wispy gulped.

"Like what?" Victor asked.

"Dr. Carson helped me escape from my system intended to determine if I was a danger to society or not. He said that if I was deemed 'at risk,' I would be killed."

"Escape?" Mouse said.

"And what did the system say?" Wispy asked, stepping up to the smooth black cube as she spoke she lightly touched the edge with her sleeve.

<-- time! 274. 1,644 /hr -->
<--- start: 8:18 --->

"That," But before he could finish, Victor grabbed a small sawed off pvc pipe and a painters tarp from a pile of dibre in the corner. Chucking the tarp over Aige, he quickly started sshing the party and then held coughing in an exaggerated fashion.

"What the hell are-" Carla said, but just then the door opened, the two men stepping in. The scanned the group of teenagers who all stood stunned, Victor quickly hid the large pipe behind his back, still pretending to cough under his breath.

The taller man gave a scornful look to each of them individually. Then finally spoke. "Which of you is Jacob Carter?" No one moved at first, then Mouse raised his hand. 

"Dude," Victor said awkwardly and began to sway. Carla punched him in the arm and glared. "Wow, man! That hurt!" His voice was slow and drawn out."

"Shut up," she scolded in a whisper, not fully understanding what his plan was. The men looked at each other, then turned back to Mouse.

"Jacob, we'd like to ask you some questions about your father."

"My dad?" 

"Yes. Can we uh, speak in private?" Mouse looked around at his friends once again, then nodded and showed the men into the kitchen. As the door to the house shut, Carla's mouth opened. 

"What the hell was that?" She said, punching Victor in the same spot she had before. Victor chuckled. 

"You did great Carla!" Victor tossed the pipe back to the pile of trash and made his way over to the window. He couldn't see anyone through the kitchen window, so likely they couldn't the teenagers either. "Ok, we don't have much time. Aige, we need to get you of here, right?" 

"That would be preferable, to going back to Sieve Co., yes." He replied from under the paint splattered cloth. "Ok, here's what we're going to do.

"We're very sorry for your loss, Jacob." The man said, though his expression was quite neutral. Mouse's eyes began to water. "But given the importance of your fathers work, and its," Kenneth paused and fiddled with his glasses before continuing. "Well, given the extreme nature of the chemicals your father was exposed to, its very important that we insure none of those toxins made it here. Jacob," he reached his hand out and touched the part of the table Mouses eyes had uncontousnly fixated on between them, pulling him back to the conversation. "Do you understand what I'm saying?"

"You," he thought for a moment, an inkling of realization setting in. "You need to search my house?" 

"For your safety. For this comunities safety," he folded his glasses and placed them into the pocket on the inside of his coat. "Jake- can I call you Jake? The chemicals that killed your father can lie dormant on a single piece of clothing for months, going completely unnoticed." He pulled a wad latex gloves out of his back pocket and handed a pair to his colleague- who'd yet to introduce himself, "If say, a month from now you found yourself," Kenneth shrugged, "moving in with your mother, perhaps, and uncovered an undetected sample? You'd be dead before you returned the Uhaul."

"Ok, yeah. Sure, I guess." Mouse stammered. 

"We'll be quick, Jake. And hey," he sat his hand on boys shoulder as he stepped by, "Sieve Co. takes good care of it's families. We're a military operation at it's core. We're all family here. You won't want for anything, especially given the circumstances." He patted Mouse's shoulder a few times and Mouse nodded in acknowledgement. "Check the shed," he said to his partner, who immediately turned and pulled the door open. Mouse's jaw dropped as he to protest, but the man stopped before he could say anything.

"Hey uh, is M- is Jacob still here?" He could hear Victors voice from the stoop. The man stepped a side and gestured for the boy to enter, but he just leaned in. "Uh, Hey, dude, we're- uh" he stammered in that same slow, stoner voice he'd used earlier.

"It's cool, bro" Mouse replied, the odd sensation of the weird nickname on his tongue made him feel even more out of place, but Kenneths partner didn't seem to notice. Victor waved stiffly, then scurried over to his car and cranked it up. Kenneths partner walked with him most of the way, the looked once more at the teenagers through the windshield as he passed in front of the car and made his way into the garage. 

As the suited man looked entered the garage, felt as if something had changed, but he wasn't sure exactly what. Shrugging it off, he began pulling back boxes and scrap paneling, tossing much of it aside.

"All clear," came Kenneths voice 20 minutes later. 

"Same for me," his partner replied mechanically.

"Well, that settles it," Kenneth sad softly to Mouse who still sat at the dining room table <-- didn't mention they were at the table did I? --> . "Here's my contact info, if you need anything, please don't hesitate," he flashed the small white card, the placed it on the table. As he removed his gloves he ushered his partner out the door, then turned once more to regard the still shocked boy. "I'm sorry again, Jake." And they were gone.

Mouse heard the car doors slam shut and the car revving as it pulled away. He yanked the phone out of his pocket and began typing. His thumb hovered over the send button, but he hesitated. Then deleted the message and started again. 

*We need to talk.*

He pressed send and placed the phone on the table. Then he began to cry.
