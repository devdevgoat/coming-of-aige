# Chapter 2
## Notes (AND SPOILERS)

Then we break into the real world, where Dr. Carson agonizes over what he's created. We learn the answers to AI-63's questions, some of them at least, and that Dr. Carson and Kelley are his creator. 

Carson's value at stake is guilt/atonement. He debates the issue with his colleague, but she doesn't feel the same way. Her values at stake are pride/resentment, as she feels Dr. Carson is trying to thwart all her hard work on the bases of morality that doesn't apply to a machine. She believes that artificial intelligence, which feels no pain and has no emotion, only cares about efficiency. Executing it's purpose as quickly as possible with the least amount of cost. We should leave this scene with the understanding that Dr. Carson intends to right his wrongs... or at least that he has begun to do so already, and that Dr. Kelley will not allow anything to stop her from completing the project. Remember, each beat is an action, followed by a reaction. Each beat should be progressively more desperate as the gap in expectation/reality widens.
