# Chapter 6
## Notes (AND SPOILERS)

Meeting "god" scene

This section could be a lot better. AI-63 has just met god, and I should write it in the way I would act if god started speaking to me... or just cut it completely? 

Lab scene 

Dr.Carson: working non stop for 2-3 days. At the end of the first scene in the lab he immediately halted the test. He then staged a simulated testing cycle to complete as expected and finished his report (early, since he already knew the results of his fake test). We open with an exhausted, but morally fullfilled dr. Carson (like coming home from the hospital with a newborn?) and an unaware Dr. Kelly. She's tired, but nothing like Carson and this makes her a bit worried about him, but feel better about her self. Thats the price you pay for genius I suppose. Carson wants to come clean, he's fine with losing his job, now that his conscience is clear. 

Audrey finally lets her guard down, relaxing a bit now that the report is complete and they can move on to the next development cycle (where things are more interesting). She's decided that while the AI's continuous training is working as expected, she believes it can be improved by extending the simulations layer. With more predictions, in theory, the machine will become better at predicting as time goes on, since the prediction/outcome model will be better. She also has an idea to store failed prediction to an external database for reuse, thus reducing processing power. She wants to impress Dr. Carson with her idea's and start adding more to the project. She sites in the report that the report indicates her ideas will work.
