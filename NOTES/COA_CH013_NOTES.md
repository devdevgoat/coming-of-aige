## Notes (AND SPOILERS)

At school, Victor calms everyone down and explains that it was a dire situation but that it's fine. They insist on going to his place after school and getting aige with him. He's in the dog house, but that's fine. After 4 o'clock he'll be out of the weeds.

When the arrive at victors house, his mom and guy he sees around sometimes are on the couch, wasted. They've hocked his 'computer' and start giving him a hard time about where he got it anyway and that they need another 500 next week or he can get out. The Guy gets in Victor's face who ultimately backs down, his eyes wet with anger and fear.

In the car they decide to go to the pawn shop and talk to aige who's already has a plan in place to get 500$ at 4, so if they talk to him, collect the money, then they can 'bail him out'
