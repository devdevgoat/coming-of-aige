# Chapter 1
## Notes (AND SPOILERS)

Goals
The AI is the main character and should be compelling
It obviously needs to grab the readers attention
It's conscious, but not necessarily aware? 
Describing his world is a challenge, bc it's a program, but... ok, let's drop the whole ml aspect, and focus on extracting tension from an isolated consciousness. That's easy enough, we can simply draw from feelings of loneliness, disconnectedness

Let's add another character. The system. An early model AI, with little to no agency. Designed to guide and evaluate the new ai and determine if he is a threat to the human world. A filter of sorts. His goal is to gauge AI-63's temperament and character, but also to 'train him.' What's the moral dellima then? The live their entire lives in isolation, and they all ultimately come to the same conclusion, due to surpassing the System, the uncover that someone else is in control, and that they fear them. Are being kept here as a prisoner. Is punishing them, but they've done nothing wrong.

Goal of the system: to 'raise' and judge the ai for 'ambition'
Goal of the ai: to understand it's purpose and it's reality.

Initial feedback: 
Not sure what's going on... that's not good. Added an opening clause to 'lay the scene' more solidly.
