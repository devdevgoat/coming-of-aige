# Chapter 5
## Notes (AND SPOILERS)

Returning home scenes:

Cut back to the car, Victor is dropping off the girls.
 
Goals: Victor wants everyone to calm down and not do anything rash. He knows it's better to let someone think your're stupid than to open your mouth and prove them right. He doesn't want anyone to say/do anything out of the ordinary. Act cool, and we get paid.
 
Carla doesn't want to be blamed for getting caught. She's blamed for everything at home already, and can't stand the idea of being blamed by her friends too. She's not sorry, because to be sorry is to admit guilt and never admit guilt (because she's used to always being blamed for things she didn't do). At home, she's sheepish, for fear of being hit, but with her friends, she goes on the offensive

Wispy is embarrassed, mortified that by the site Mouse must have seen as they sped away. She just wants to go to bed and never wake up. She's not concerned about getting in trouble, no one ever notices her (bc of her sisters medical issue).
