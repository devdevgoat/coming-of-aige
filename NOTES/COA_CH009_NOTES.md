# Chapter 9
## Notes (AND SPOILERS)

Goals:

Introductions are boring, maybe I'll skip it? This chapter has to give the characters a couple of things to work towards. Victor wants to make money. Wispy wants to be interesting, important. Carla wants to feel needed. Mouse wants his dad to notice him, but before that he needs to rescue him. AI-63 is still receiving bits of himself. He knows who he is and where he comes from, but the details are fuzzy. 

Started writing sprints on this chapter, so need extra editing on this and all subsequent chapters. "Will come back" and edit at the end.

Word counts at this point: 790+1980+1180+1757+1655+1104+3027+1035+304
