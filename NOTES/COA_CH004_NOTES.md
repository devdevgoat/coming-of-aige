# Chapter 4
## Notes (AND SPOILERS)

Interrogation scene:

Scene is not about what the scene is about. Mouse is arrested, his father is called from work to pick him up. He might be expelled. The principal is there, their it guy says the logs show changes to the grades database. Mouse is caught, but he doesn't care. What does he care about? He cares about his dads attention. Wishes they'd spend more time together, like they used to. Dr. Carson is too overworked. Distracted. He mis interprets his sons detachment for rebellion, pot smoking? Could play off the trope of 'are you on marajuna, son?' 

Goals: 
Dr. Carson, retrieve his son as quickly as possible and get back to work. Mouse is a clone here, so anything Dr. Carson berates his son for will fall back on him
Mouse: Talk to his dad. Finally get some time with him, even if it's just a car ride
Principal: Punish Mouse and find out who else was involved
