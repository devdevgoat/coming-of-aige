# Chapter 11
## Notes (AND SPOILERS)

It's Tuesday, and Victor is getting more pressure from his mom to have 500$ (need to update the original 50 in chapter 5) by tomorrow. He needs Aige's help, the other kids aren't paying, saying the don't know what he's talking about and heard he'd gotten into a lot of trouble and don't want to be a part of it. He convinces Wispy (separately from the group) to let him talk to aige tonight.
