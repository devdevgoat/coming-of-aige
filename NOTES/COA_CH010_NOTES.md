# Chapter 10
## Notes (AND SPOILERS)

"What do we do now?" Wispy asked, eyeing the cube next to her as they bumped along down a dirt road in Victor's Camry. The heavy metal cube sung low into the cushioned rear seat, and the seat belt, which Carla had insisted on, huge its corners awkwardly. 
  
"Lets rob a bank!" Aige replied.

This chapter needs to open up at least one subplot. Also, Aige can do an info dump on these three, which will come in handy as a chance for conflict/confusion when Victor botches the relay of that info. They decide to hide Aige, but argue over who's hose to keep it at, before deciding that Wispy's would be the best place for now. Though Victor would like to keep it, in hopes to use him for some financial gain. He suggests a rotation system.

Wispy and Aige return to her house, we get a better look at her struggles, which are more subtle than the others. Her and Aige get along on the lines of caring. She cares about how aige feels the most out of the group and thinks he's funny. She confides that she wishes she could do something to make people notice her. Aige, still young and naive about people in general... needs to give some bad advice here.
