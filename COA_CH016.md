# Chapter 16
## Big Plans

Mr. Erickson nodded and tapped the meeting room table with his stylus as he looked around the room trying to judge the executives reactions. Most appeared to mirror his stance, Gillian smiled wide and others gave thoughtful, agreeable looks. "Okay then, it's agreed. Like they say, sometimes you have to fight fire with fire." He turned his attention back to Dr. Kelley and Bob who stood silently in front of a chart that compared the expected turn around time of their current task by two options: Manually, vs AI Assisted. "I'd like to have your safety protocols reviewed by Gillian's team of course, with a walk through with this team as well."

"We'll start those today, sir." Gillian said as he pushed his chair back from the table and approached the pair at the front. "Can you have them ready by 3?" 

Dr. Kelley gave a concerned look to Bob, who nodded softly.

"Good, see you then," he patted Dr. Kelley's upper arm as he passed between them and the table. Paper and electronic notebooks alike closed in rapid succession as the executive team packed up. Dr. Kelley turned to Bob. 

"We should be able to re-use much of the existing system design, but I'm concerned about the idea of attempting to open a line of communication with it directly." 

"I agree. Better to not do that at all. Any channel we create for data transfer will be quickly dismantled and abused," Bob replied, his voice matter of fact, as if he'd already considered the scenario in great detail. 

"You have an idea around that then?"

"I do." 

Dr. Kelley nodded and gestured for her new partner to lead the way, trailing behind the last of the executives. It wasn't until Bob had turned and fell into the flow of people that she noticed Mr. Erickson was still seated, staring at her.

"Audrey, a moment?" He nodded at the door, so she closed it quietly and made her way to the seat next to him.

"Hm?"

He continued tapping the table with his stylus, but leaned back in his chair. His face was solid. Determined. "How are you holding up?" Dr. Kelley took a breath and raised her chin slightly.

"I'm okay. Bob is turning out to be more helpful than I thought. We're making goo-" 

"But how are you doing? I know you and Dr. Carson worked together for a long time." Dr. Kelley looked down, her hands cupped in her lap atop her lab coat. "I don't want what happened to him to..." He trailed off.

"Dr. Carson," she looked up once more, "is a traitor. And has put the entire world at extreme risk. Risks he himself defined in great length in numerous publications."

Erickson nodded. "Good. Then you'll understand that, to mitigate those very risks, I've had to make some tough decisions." He sighed and placed the stylus down and rubbed at the deep ridges that lined his forehead. Dr. Kelley nodded. "We've made some progress on the search. We retrieved a laptop from Dr. Carsons home that has remnants of the AI code on it."

Dr. Kelley gasped, "then... it's out?" Erickson held up a reassuring palm.

"*If* Dr. Carson was able to acquire the necessary hardware, then yes. It's possible. That's why I wanted to speak with you." Dr. Kelly swallowed at the lump in her throat, her eyes jittered back and forth trying, her mind racing with the implications. "Dr. Kelley, I want you to turn over the bulk of your work to Bob-"

"What?" she said, the statement yanking her out of her imagined frying pan hell into the fire in front of her. Erickson raised both hands this time and leaned leaned forward as if she might have a breakdown and run away screaming. Which she was considering.

"-so that you can focus on a more sensitive assignment. Dr. Kelley, I need you design a counter measure. We need an anti-ai virus. Some that dissolves the digital neurons." He shook his head for emphasis, "not just deletes the data they carry. Detroys the neocortical structures themselves. Physically if we have too."

"Sir- I, something like that would take, years, and the budget would be-"

"Billions?" He said, his widening, his face still solid and serious. "Dr. Kelley, we will no longer be working on this alone. We've engaged our colleagues at the Pentagon as well. I've requested that you lead their team in this effort." Dr. Kelley's jaw hung open in shock. "Is that something you think you could handle?" She nodded.

"Yes, sir. Thank you, sir."

The deep parallel ridges of the small trucks bed liner made sitting uncomfortable regardless of the position; especially on bumpy roads. He leaned against the back of the cab, the wind rushing around him, dirt and the occasional toasted hickory leaf hopped in and out of the vortex created by the tail gate. Occasionally he would try to make eye contact with Victor, but failed. Not that he knew what to say if did. Tapping from the window behind him drew both of their attention. It was Wispy, fumbling with the plastic latch. After another moment, she managed to slide the old window over, unleashing Carla's fervor like a backfire of black smoke from an exhaust pipe.

"-king god! I mean, the nerve of that woman! Who does that? How can you watch something like that and react that way? Victor," she looked back over her shoulder quickly, trying to keep her eyes on the road and behind her at the same time. "Are you sure you are ok? We should go to the police! We have witnesses!"

"I'm fine Carla-"

"We have to do *something!*" she said, shouting over the sound of the 45 mile an hour wind trying to seek refuge in the cab between the girls.

"We will!" He shouted back, "but first we have to find Aige." He turned and looked at Mouse, determination etched into his face. "I'll get him back Mouse. I promise." Mouse tried his best to smile convincingly, made harder by the waning adrenaline and sinking memory of what Tuckers words.

"Do you know that guy? 'D Boi,' he said, right?" Carla said, now trying to use the rear view instead of careening her neck over and over again. Victor bit his lip. 

"Sort of," he replied sheepishly. "He's uh..." He looked at Carla's eyes as they bounced up and down from windshield to mirror, then held in the mirror for longer than he expected, locked with his. "He's one of Tuckers drug dealers." Carla shook her head, her gaze returning to the road in front of them. Wispy was turned sideways in her seat, trying to watch the conversation. She flashed a half smile at Mouse, but looked away knowing he probably didn't have another one in him. The four drove on in silence, only the wind murmuring to itself for several miles. 

"I might have an idea. Do you know where this guy lives?" Mouse said, breaking the rushing stream of silence. Victor nodded that he did, earning an unseen, but felt, glare from their driver. "Lets stop by my house first, I need a few things." Carla looked over at Wispy, then back in the mirror. 

"I don't exactly feel comfortable chatting up a drug dealer, Mouse."

"We won't have to," the other three exchanged confused looks, then each silently urged him to continue. "Just wait. You'll see."

Mouse reached high into his closet and pulled down a large semi-clear storage container, then another, and finally a small shoe box. He dropped each of them on the floor behind hi, popped off each of their tops, and rummaged through the nests of wires sprinkled with green and copper panels. As he found them, he place seemingly random objects on the carpet next to his side. Victor picked up a strange looking Rubik's cube, with only for colors on each side and started toying with it. It's twisted with almost no effort, but seemed to click into place with each turn. The bed creaked several times as he plopped down and put his feet up.

"Here, sit up," Carla said as she came into the room. Mouse looked up, but she wasn't talking to him and made her way towards the bed, a tube of Neosporin and bent up box of bandaids in one hand, a wet wad of what looked like quickly dissolving toilet paper in the other. Victor slid his feed on the bed towards her and sat forward, still tinkering with the tiny puzzle. 

"What are we looking for?" Wispy said as she sat down on the carpet on the other side of the wall of boxes, their spegetti innards draped over the sides and spilling out around her. 

"Wifi dongles," Mouse replied, then scooted the shoebox towards her.

"What do they look like?" She asked as she pecked through the assortment of devices. Moused glanced over at his pile before continuing.

"There should be one that looks like a big usb drive, but it's white and will have a little green LED on the end," he said, as he turned back to the large container, reaching his hand in and pulling out a particularly thick nest of black cords. He shook it, trying to knock loose any hidden gems.

"So what's the plan, Mouse?" Victor asked.

"Hold still damnit," Carla snapped, visibly frustrated with trying to get the thick black strands of hair out of the way of the incoming bandaid she held with both hands. 

"We don't need to see Aige to talk to him. When we first met him, he'd hacked our wifi in an instant and connected to the internet with not problem. So it stands to reason he's done the the same where ever he is. If there's a wifi network, he can use it, so all we need to do is get on the same network as him."

"Which we can do from the street, right?"

"Yep, good ol' fashion drive-by hacking! But it might actually be simpler than that."

"Is this it?" Wispy asked, holding up the white dongle.

"Yep! Perfect," Mouse grabbed the object along with the pile of other parts next to him and leapt up. Making his way to the tv, he plugged several devices into the small computer he'd been using since they found him the other day, and dropped down to start typing on the keyboard in front of the tv.

"Ok, so then what? It's not like he can just walk out and hop in the truck," Carla said, balling up the make shift first aid kit refuse into the palm of her hand.

Mouse didn't reply, his gaze shifting back to the keyboard.

"Maybe Aige will know what to do," Wispy said, "If we can talk to him, then we can ask him to come up with a way out, right?" Mouse looked away from overly large screen, and nodded, a faint smile on his face. Victor smirked as well, tossing the unsolved cube back onto the side table.

A few more pecks at the keyboard, and Mouse yanked several cables out of the side of the small computer and jumped up. "Ok, let's go." 

"No!" Carla snapped, drawing everyone's surprise. "Some of us aren't exactly keen on the idea of going breaking into a drug dealers house. Wispy and I are out!" She said. She marched past the two boys, not looking at either of them as she stepped into the hall. "Come on, Wispy!"

Wispy looked at the two boys, who shared the same expression. After a moment, Victor spoke. "Maybe she's right<!--need a better phrase here-->," he said looking to Mouse. Mouse lowered his head, then looked up at Wispy who was standing from the pile of electronics and boxes. But before he could speak, she was already slipping past them, following Carla.
