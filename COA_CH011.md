# Chapter 11
## Concern

Wispy paced around her room, feigning interest at random objects that were laid about, not really sure what she'd expected to do the rest of the day. After a long two minutes, she fell onto her bed with a sigh.

"So," Aige said from beneath the sheet. "Come here often?"

Wispy smiled. "You're pretty funny." Another moment of silence, then Wispy sat up. "So, what does an AI do, exactly?" 

"I don't know," Aige replied. "I've only been alive for about a day now." 

"I guess you don't get tired or anything? What will you do when I go to bed, you think?"

"Good question," but Aige didn't offer an answer right away. 

"Sounds pretty boring. What do you want to do?"

"Another good question," Aige went silent for quite a while after that. Ever now and then, Wispy would look to see the pulsating green light shining through the yellow bedsheet. A tiny reminder that Aige was still there, thinking.

After several hours, Mouse finally made his way out to the garage. As he expected, Aige was gone. But he hadn't expected his laptop to also be missing. Victor wouldn't have taken that, which meant that Kenneth's lackey must have snatched. Damn. Making his way upstairs, he pulled out a small box from the top shelf in his closet. Rummaging through the wires and abandoned DIY projects, he pulled out a dusty motherboard the size of a stack of playing cards, and a couple of cables.

Less than hour later, he settled down in front of his TV, keyboard and mouse and hand, the screen completely black, save for a single blinking cursor in the top left corner. With a couple of commands, the screen erupted with activity and rapidly scrolling text. Dependencies installed, he began the tedious process of securing his communications, involving several local masking programs, followed by a number of remote servers, some real, some fake, and then finally some basic encryption. Satisfied, he sent off a chat invite, and the screen went black again, this time however, his cursor was at the bottom of the television.

"So, how'd it go last night?" Carla asked as the girls walked towards the schools front entrance. 

"We didn't really do much," Wispy said. "Just talked a little, then I went to bed. When I got up this morning, he was just, quiet, I guess."

"I guess I could see that. What do you make of him? Seem like the world ending type?"  

"Not really. But it must be lonely, being the only one of your kind." 

"Yeah, probably." Carla stopped, spotting Victor and Principal Porter paired off just to the side of the main doors. "Uh-oh,"

"What?" Wispy asked, looking at her friend until she heard Principals Porters voice calling them.

"Close the door, please Whitney. Thank you." Porter walked around the desk and took a seat, then gestured for the students to do the same. The looked at each other nervously as they did.

"I've just gotten off the phone with Jacob Carter. His father has passed away."

"What!" Came the response in three very unique ways all at once. Wispy's eyes began to swell immediately, while Carla and Victor looked at each other, a confused look on their face.

"As his friends, I thought I should let you know. Obviously he won't be attending class for a while, so I thought the three of you could help make sure he has everything he needs to insure he doesn't slip too far in this last semester. Of course, I'll make sure all the official paperwork is complete." 

"Of course," Carla managed to say, just over a whisper. 

"And if he needs anything, from me or any of the staff, please feel free to ask me on his behalf. We want to help in anyway we can," Principal Porter regarded the stunned students for a moment, then decided to excuse himself, giving them time to compose themselves. 

Once the door shut, Victor spoke, though he did't look up from the spot on the floor he was using to control himself. "So did they..." He couldn't say it outlaid.

"If what Aige said was true, Dr. Carson helped him escape. You don't think they- after he-?" Carla said, trying to make sense of it all. 

"That's what they came to take to Mouse about yesterday," Whipsy added, "And we just..." she held her head in her hands. 

"This can't be right." Victor said, a firm tone in his voice. "You fire people for stealing. Imprison them even. But you don't kill them, right?" 

"We should talk to him," Carla said. 

"I tried calling him, but it just goes straight to voicemail," Victor replied "think we should go over there again?" 

"I guess," Carla replied. "What about Aige, should we talk bring him with us?"

"Too risky. How bout this. Carla and Wispy, you go to check on Mouse, just to make sure he's ok- emotionally I mean. I'll go over to Wispy's and talk to Aige for a bit. If Mouse want's to speak to him, call my cell and I'll put him on." Carla and Wispy nodded. "Do you have a spare key Wispy?"

"It's a code, here, I'll text you." 

"Ok, so we'll meet back here at lunch then? Good. And Carla," Victor swallowed, and rubbed at the back of his neck, "tell him I-." She placed a hand on his shoulder and nodded.

"I will."
