## ROI

A: Looks like you were right
M: Yeah?
A: There's definitely something fishy going on
M: Source?
A: Nothing tangible, can't get anything out. But there's no record of any poisoning or accidental deaths. Only some very strange system logs, and that your dad was definitely... removed as a result.
M: Yeah... Thanks man, I owe you one
A: You owe me a lot more than that
A: <disconnected>

"Hows my favorite robot?" Victor said as he swung open the door to Wispy's room.

"I'm not a robot," Aige replied. "Um, excuse me? Where are we going?"

"I'll explain in the car."

---

"Should we just go in?" Carla asked, cupping her palm as she tried to see through the window and into the dark kitchen.

"Maybe he just needs some time," Wispy replied, but Carla turned the knob anyway. As they made their way up the stairs, <-- need to get rid of these! --> The house was quiet, dark. From the stairs, however, Wispy could see a light coming from under the door of Mouse's room. She watched as Carla knocked. 

"Mouse? You there?" The door opened slowly. Wispy knew what she'd see and adverted her eyes. She didn't want to see him depressed like that. The puffed, swollen eyes from hours of crying. The stretched and wrinkled clothes of someone who's not changed in days. 

"Good, you're here!" Mouse said. Wispy looked up, but he'd already turned and made his way back towards the foot of his bed. "I have something I need to show you guys," he picked up his keyboard and sat it on his lap and began typing.

The girls looked at each other, heads cocked. "Ok, sure, Mouse." Carla said. "But, um," she walked over and sat next to him, causing them both to bounce slight, and put her arm around him. Wispy tensed, then quickly chastised herself silently for her selfishness. She leaned against the door frame and tried to make sense of the text on the TV. "Mouse, we heard about your dad."

"Huh, oh yeah," He said, not looking up from the screen as he typed.

"If you need to talk about it," Carla said, glancing at Wispy and waving for her to come over, but she just looked at her shoes.

"About what?" Mouse said, turning his head away from the TV for the first time. Carla leaned away, confused.

"About-" 

"What are you working on?" Wispy asked.

"Oh- ok, so look at this," he slid off the bed and scooted up to the TV close enough to touch it. He traced his fingers down the screen and then across a particular line. "See this?" Wispy stepped in and leaned over the boys shoulder.

"Mm-hm," she said, though it may have been Chinese for all she knew. 

"It's the same kind of scripts that Aige output when he first turned on, right before he hosed my laptop." 

"Okay," Wispy said, trying to not sound lost already.

"But look here," he slid his finger to far left side of the screen where a series of numbers were wrapped in brackets. "This log line was for last night, after Aige woke up."

"What is this, exactly?" Carla said.

"One of the servers that Aige compromised during his escape from Sieve Co, here check this out."

"Whoa, whoa- hold on a minute," Carla said, standing up from the bed and backing away from the screen. "Did you hack into your Dads company? The company that sent two secret agents to your house?" 

"No," Mouse's voice went low and he glared at the girl behind him. "I hacked into the company that sent two soldiers to search my house and try to convince me that my dad was dead."

Carla looked away. "Mouse, I..." But she didn't know what to say. She'd expected denial, but only the 'it's not fair' variety that she'd went through with her mother. Conspiratorial denial was way outside of her wheelhouse.

"So what does this mean?" Wispy said. Mouse's glare broke, and turned back to Wispy. 

"I think it means that Aige's memories are still out there, spread across several servers, like a bunch of micro backups. It could also mean," Mouse's voice trailed off. Wispy knelt down next to him, and, trying not to shake, put her hand on his back.  He looked at the girl, who now saw the weariness in his eyes. "I think it might be a trail. Breadcrumbs that will lead me to him." Carla gasped. "I need to talk to Aige to be sure. But we can't take any chances, nothing that can be traced easily. I need to talk to him in person. To show him this."

"Ok, so here's the deal," Victor said into the rear view mirror.

"You've kidnapped me and are going to sell me on the black market?"

"No," Victor sighed, "I need your help with something." Victor decided to take the lack of a 'no' as permission to continue. "I need to make $500."

"You are going to sell me!" Aige said with a gasped, then proceeded to play an alarm at full volume. "Help! Help!" He chanted obnoxiously, causing Victor to jerk the wheel and turn in his seat in surprise.

"Would you cut that out," the car straightened and he turned his sights back to the road. "I'm not going to sell you!" Though now he wasn't so sure, he shot a glare at the cube through the mirror. "Listen, you're an AI right? That means you're super smart? Well, that means you can do things, like," he looked once more through the mirror, "play the stock market?"

Aige thought for a moment, then replied. "Yes, I can, though only at a limited capacity in this body." 

"What do you mean?" 

"Well, the stock market is, more or less, a financial representation of the current emotional state of the people involved. A natural evolution of a fiat based currency within a capitalistic society."

"Uh, okay?" Victor replied. Aige sighed.

"Let's just say, I need a lot of information, like, all of it, so that I can 'guess' how people will react to a given stock over time. When will they buy? When will they buy? I can likely make pretty good predictions against one stock given the storage capacity of this body."

"Yeah?" Victor replied, "Enough to make $500 dollars?" 

"Absolutely!" Aige replied, earning a smile and a nod from his driver. "What's our starting investment and expected pay out date?"

"Tomorrow!" Victor said, his head still nodding to himself. Aige was silent for a moment.

"Ok, I recommend we start with an initial investment of $15,000"
  
"What?" Victor yelled into the mirror, Aige chuckled from the backseat. 

"Also, it takes like three business days just to get your money out of the stock market, you realize that right?"

"I think I will sell you," Victor mumbled as he turned into the small trailer park.

Having confirmed his mother was no where in site, Victor skipped down the rickety wooden staircase opened the rear passenger door to retrieve Aige. After maneuvering the cube down the awkward hall way and into his room, he collapsed onto his futon with a huff.

"Damn you're heavy, what are you made of exactly?" 

"Highly dense silicon. Like a 1000 normal computers stacked onto of each other. The rest of the weight comes from the battery and a cooling device."

"Well it's heavy, whatever it is. Anyway, back to the problem at hand. My mom says we owe $500 in bills and that we need it by wed,"

"And this concerns me because?" Aige asked. Victor shrugged, then smirked.

"How much is that silicon worth in raw materials alone again?"

"So this is a hostage situation. Need I remind you, I'll scream." 

"No, you're not a hostage," Victor sighed. "The last time I tried something shady it didn't end so well." Victor fiddled with the torn fabric liner of his futon, pulling off little threads and dropping it into one of the holes in the metal frame meant for some purpose long since forgotten. "So I was hoping," he stressed the word, "that you could help me do it legitimately." He shot the black cube a look, then went back to the slow destruction of his mattress cover.

Aige sighed. "I'll see what I can do, I think I have a few ideas. I see you don't have internet, but your neighbors do. Give me a couple of hours, ok?"

"Great!" He sat up, an eager smile on his face. "Can you show me how after you do? Do you think it something I could do on my own?"

"Well, maybe. Let me try some things and get back to you ok? I'll need some information from you first, you have a bank account at least?" 

"Yep!" 

"Address?"
