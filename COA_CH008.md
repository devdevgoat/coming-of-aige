# Chapter 8
## New Friends

"Dude, you could have sent a text or something? For all we knew your were in prison!" Victor said as soon as he saw Mouse step out of the garage. 

"Huh? Oh, yeah. Sorry about that."

Carla stepped forward to hug their assumed fallen comrade, "Jeez, Mouse. Have you slept?" Then she paused just before and made an exaggerated face of disgust. "Or- better question, when's the last time you took a shower?"

"Yeah, I've been a little busy with something?" 

"Listen, Mouse I hope you're not sore with us? I mean, what did you expect us to do?" Victor pleaded, rubbing the back of his neck, but for the most part maintaining eye contact.

"Um, hi, Mouse. Sorry we just-" Wispy tried to interject.

"What do you mean, busy?" Carla blurted out. 

"It's nothing, just something I was working on. Guys, it's cool, but Pince Porter is gunning for you, just an FYI."

"Yeah we bumped into him on our way here. So we're cool then? Listen, I haven't collected payment yet, but as far I'm concerned, all our clients should be good to go, despite our little hiccup. Unless you," Victor let his voice trail off.

Mouse sighed and gave his accuser a look.

"Ok, ok, I was just making sure," Victor replied behind raised palms. "Anyway we just came to check up on-"

"Hey, Mouse! What is this thing?" Carla's voice called from the garage. Mouse trailed behind as the rest of the group funneled into the small workshop. When he rounded the corner, Carla was rocking the cube left and right on its edges.

"I'm not really sure what it is," he said. "I've been trying to figure it out all night." Mouse tapped the spacebar on his laptop and the screen returned to full brightness, displaying a ton of windows with random dumps of text. "It's some sort of computer, that's for certain, but it's nothing I've ever seen before. It's like it's built on a completely different kind of hardware."

"What do you mean?" Victor replied. "Looks expensive, whatever it is." He stroked the top of the pitch black cube. "Wanna touch it Wisp?" He asked as she looked over his shoulder, but she shook her head and stepped back.

"Well, for starters, I tried writing some data to it via this serial port, just some ones and zeros at first, but," he shook his head. "It's hard to explain. Sometimes the data stuck, and sometimes it didn't."

"Is it broken?" Carla asked.

"Maybe," Mouse said.

"I hope not." Carla dropped the cube and leapt back as if it had just spoken to her. The teenagers looked at each other, eyes wide.

"Did it just," Victor asked no one in particular. Mouse grabbed his computer and began closing windows in rapid succession until he came across one that had been obscured by the others. A stream of unrecognizable text scrolled at fluctuating speeds.

"What the hell?" Mouse muttered to himself as he leaned close to the window. Then the screen went black, and he reared back, confused. He tapped the spacebar, the enter key, the power button, all had the same effect: none.

"That's a little rude, don't you think?" The cube spoke again, its voice calm and full, despite the lack of visible speakers. Mouse's jaw hung open as he tried to understand what just happened. 

"Mouse what is this, some sort of weird payback?" Victor asked, a nervous chuckle punctuating the question.

"I think the damn thing just bricked my machine," Mouse said, the ripped off the cable that connected the two devices and pressed his thumb down hard on the power button once more. His gaze bouncing between the screen and the cube on the work bench.

"Well, what would you do if you found a print out of all of your deepest thoughts and desires? I'm AI-63, by the way. Nice to meet you." 

"You're," Carla stammered as she looked teach of her companions for assistance, any assistance in understanding what she was trying to do or say.

"A. I. 6. 3. That's my name," AI-63 replied sarcastically. "You know what a name is right?"

"Whoa," Victor said, mouth still agape.

"Yeah," Mouse replied. He looked around the group once again, still in shock. Wispy shrugged, not sure what to say, and Carla was speechless.

"Well, if you think this is something, you should try at 6GHz!" After a moment of silence, the sound of drums and a simple played, causing even more confusion.

"Did- did the computer just sigh?" Victor asked.

<-Really struggled with this scene. Need a better way to express  shock. The end was literally just the same beat over and over again->
