# Chapter 5
## Homecoming

After what felt like an eternity, the stop light switched to green. But the adrenaline had worn off by now, and victor turned the wheel lazily counter clockwise, letting it right itself at the peak of the turn. They took the bypass to the other side of town before deciding to head towards anyone's home, just in case. The new route put Carla's place first on the list. As they approached the driveway, Victor slowed and stopped short in the road as he leaned out the window to get a look at the small duplex on the corner.

"Your folks still up?" He asked, breaking a silence that had lasted for miles. "Need me to drop you off around the back?"

Carla peered around the headrest at the front window, a disco of muted colors flashing from the inside.

"Nah, it's fine." 

"You sure? Listen if they ask any questions-"

"It's fine," she urged, then looked back at her phone for the hundredth time. 12:50. He should be passed out by now.

With a sigh, Victor pulled the rest of the way up to the driveway and Carla hopped out, from the passenger side and leaned in to hug Wispy through the window.

"You sure you're ok?" She asked. 

"Yeah, just a few scrapes." Carla smiled apologetically as Wispy tried to inspect the back of arm. 

"Sorry about that, I kinda froze back there." 

"Hey, remember what I said. Don't do anything st-"

"Shut up, Victor!," she said, interrupting the same axiom he'd repeated since burning out of the parking lot. "This whole damn situation is stupid."

"What are you pissed at me for? It's your fault we're in this mess! If you hadn't," but before he could finish, Carla slapped stormed off, pounding the hood of the car as she passed it.

"Fuck you, Victor!" Then made her way up the steps and through the front door. Victor glanced over at his remaining passenger with a look of confusion, but she just toyed with a small rip at the end of her sleeve. 

"What's her problem?"

As the screen door slammed behind her, she winced. 'That might actually be too loud,' she thought to herself. Across the living room, the back of a large recliner rocked back and forth, slivers of an infomercial spilling over into view. She could see a trail of smoke trailing off of the far armrest.

With a sigh of relief, she walked around and removed the mostly ashed cigarette from her father's thick, wooly knuckles.

"I swear to god you're going to burn this house down too one day." She muttered to herself as she snuffed it out in the ashtray. After turning off the television, she grabbed the half-empty bar glass with one hand and with the other gripped the necks of the three beer bottles scattered around it. As she reached the kitchen she inspected the brown liquor, rolling it gently around the short walls of the glass. She chuckled at the etching that read 'classy' in a floral font. She glanced once more at the overweight, half dressed trucker asleep in his recliner, then set the four empty glass on the counter and went to bed.

Victor stared at his phone, a message written, but not yet sent. If he's still in custody, then a random text from Victor Shelly at 2am would definitely give him away. But if he was home, then he wanted to know what happened. Did they find out about the database changes? Did he say anything? He took a deep breath, and decided it would have to wait. He shut the door as quietly as he could, then crept up the back porch. The door didn't lock, but it creaked a little when it was cold, so he turned the aluminum knob fully, then pulled slow, stopping at the first creak, he had just enough room to slip in.

As he made his way down the hall, he noticed the bathroom was on, and his parents room at then was ajar. As reached the his room, he let out a sigh of relief as he quietly slid aside the bedsheet that hung over the doorway.

"Where the fuck have you been?" Victor closed his eyes tight as the old woman's raspy voice scratched at the back of his skull, sending a jolt through him. He stepped back a half step and let the sheet fall back into place, and turned to face his mother at opposite end of the narrow hallway, the florescent kitchen light behind her creating a small but menacing silhouette, a small red glow hung off her right side.

She puffed the thin cigarette, then asked again. "Well?"

"Out," Victor replied coldly.

"Uh-huh," she clicked her tongue, the sound echoing off the trailers paneled walls, then turned walked towards the living room. Since she was up anyway, Victor made his way to the fridge and bent over as he searched for something to drink. From behind him he heard the sound of the plastic remote skip across the glass coffee table, and then the muffled roar of a laugh track. 

"We need 50 dollars by Wednesday," came the scratched voice over  from the living room. Victor picked up an open can of off brand soda that sat on the top shelf and shook it lightly, the last two or three sips rattling at the bottom.

"Always do," he mumbled into the fridge as he pulled the can and shut the door.

"Don't you get smart with me, boy!" The woman barked, another roar of laughter caused Victor to peak at what show happened to be on. "You better start contributing to this household soon or you're going-"

"I said, what for?" he replied from behind the soda can, just before taking a sip. The drink now just an overly sweet syrup without its usual carbonation.

His mother leaned forward. Crossing her legs under the tattered night gown she propped her smoking arm on her knee then took another drag. As if chewing on the smoke before letting it go, she clenched her jaw in disgust at the boy as he stood in the kitchen. "Bills," she finally said.

"I'm sure," Victor said, mostly to himself, as he tossed the can in the trashcan and made his way back to his room.

"Wednesday!" She shouted after him. It was times like these he wished he had a real door. Slamming a sheet behind you just didn't sent the same message.

As Wispy finished changing, she reached for the switch on the small lamp on the nightstand and flipped it off, only to hear a knock on the door, and flicked it back on again.

"Hey," came the soft voice as her mother peeked in. "Everything ok?"

"Yeah, I'm fine mom." The woman leaned back out and looked down the hall for a moment, then the floating head returned.

"Your sister didn't wake up did she, I didn't hear her call out, but I was asleep, so-"

"No I didn't hear anything, I just had to use the bathroom," Wispy said, reassuringly. Her mom smiled, the dark semicircles under her eyes folded up into deep crescents as she whispered back.

"Ok, honey. Goodnight. Love you." Then shut the door, not making a sound. Wispy flipped the light once more and with a sigh, gripped her pillow tightly and tried to will herself to sleep.

The truck door squealed as he slammed it shut. Reaching into the bed, he pulled hard on the satchel, but lost his grip as its tether snatched it back down. 

"Son of a-," Mouse leaned over the edge of the truck and began yanking at the ties, flinging the ends of each strap as he freed  them in a rage. Pulling once again, the last laptop case came free and stormed up to the kitchen door, he fished for the house key in his pocket. All the lights were still off. Same as he left it this morning. As unlocked the door, he turned and glared at the garage door for a moment.

He tossed his bag inside and let it slide across the kitchen floor, then stomped off, back across the cement driveway. By the time he reached the garage door, he was breathing hard through his nose, brimming with anger. He gripped the knob and turned hard, but it didn't budge. He stepped back and kicked it, but it remained shut. Finally, he walked around the far side and tried one of the windows. Bingo.

Once inside, he waved his and slowly in the dark until he felt a thin string hanging from the ceiling. With a tug, the workshop lit up in a blaze of blueish incandescent lighting. He looked around the small room, electronics stacked high against the far wall. Old gym equipment tucked neatly in a corner. And then, next to the door, on a makeshift workshop table, something different.

As he approached, rubbed his eyes. It was strange. It looked, almost blurry. Like he couldn't quite focus on it. The solid black cube, about a foot in all dimensions didn't reflect any light from the lamp above him. He slid his hand across the top, then let his fingers slip around one its rounded edges. It was so smooth, it felt wet, but when he inspected his fingers, they were bone dry. 

As he looked closer, he saw a think black wire snake around to the back, and at the end of it, a standard serial port. But no power button. No power cord either. After inspecting all sides, and even tilting the heavy cube back to peer underneath, he still couldn't see any other hints as to what it was. Only the serial port, which plugged into to a hole the same diameter of the cable.

"What the hell is this thing?"
