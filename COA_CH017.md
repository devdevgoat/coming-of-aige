"It's not perfect, but I think it'll do," Bob said as he reviewed the readout, and handed it Dr. Kelley who did the same. 

Bob's idea had worked after all. Prior to launching another instance, he had written to disk a number of questions, ending with one of the problematic algorithms left behind by AI-63 and Dr. Carson and a proposal. After a few moments of the system running, they did a clean shutdown, allowing time for all any for the AI to commit any important information it wanted to keep to disk prior to it losing the power. Dr. Kelley now reviewed the answers, including a much cleaner algorithm and one word on the last line: yes.

"Alright then, everything seems satisfactory. All networks are off line. Let's power it up and see how this goes." Bob nodded, and flipped the switch. The hum returned to the wall across from them, and after a moment, Dr. Kelly spoke in a commanding voice towards it, "Hello, AI-65, can you hear me?"

"Yes."

D shook his head, "nah, take another one," he said, handing the phone back to Marv. Marv sighed through his teeth, and rolled his eyes. "Don't roll yours eyes, boy! This is our brand, man."  

"What are you talking about, D?"

"Ok, check it. You know I'm cool right? You'd buy dope from me, right?" Marv made a noncommittal shrug and nod. "Your boys'll buy dope from me?" Marv repeated the gesture, his eyes wider still waiting for his partner to make a point. "But what about Starbucks girl?" Marv shook his head, and turned away.

"Man I don't even know her, she's just-"

"Exactly!" He said, leaning forward and pointing at the phone in Marvs hand. "We gotta change our brand if we want customers like  that. They don't want the sleazy back alley deal, they want a classy," he turned to regard Aige who sat behind him on the white plastered pedestal, "cultured experience." Marv rolled his eyes again, then turned back and held up the phone.

D smiled, then turned and struck a leaned over pose, regarding the piece with while he pinched his chin. Marv chuckled, "Say cheese,"

"Cheese," Aige relied.

Mr. Erickson tapped on the open door to the office. Gillian looked up from his tablet and adjusted his glasses. "Mr. Erickson?"

"I spoke to Dr. Kelley, she'll be transferring the majority of her tasks over to your guy today and taking up residence with our team at the Pentagon on Project Kupchak." Gillian nodded his head.

"Great," he said, but his annotation implied the question, 'is that all?'

"And I wanted to let you know," he tossed a glance down the hall, then leaned a bit further into the room before continuing. "We have a transport coming tomorrow." 

Gillians brow jumped for a second as he realized what Mr. Erickson had really stopped by for. "I'll let the others know."

"Thanks," he said, and he leaned back out and continued down the hall. Gillian waited a moment, then leaned back down, close to his tablet and began pecking away at a new chat message. 

G: Sounds things are going well?  
B: All according to plan  
G: And the new instance... 
B: :sigh:  
B: I said we're on schedule
G: Good  
G: Keep it that way...

The trucks heater had warmed the cab alright, a little too much.  Victor cracked the window with a quarter turn of the crank and slipped his fingers out the two inch gap, letting the autumn air roll over them, causing a slight whistle. "Turn right up here, near the post office." Mouse flipped on the blinker and pulled the shifter out of gear. "Hey man, I never got to thank you. For before." Mouse spun the wheel with the palm of his hand and stepped down on the clutch.

"I didn't really do anything, so," he shrugged briefly before changing gears again. 

"Still," Victor replied, look out the window.

"You talk to Carla about it?" 

Victor scoffed. "Pretty sure she'd hit me if I thanked her, you know." Mouse nodded. "Keep going til you get to the next light, it's down a little side street right after." 

"Sounds good," Mouse looked around as they made their way the neighborhood, a mixture of men and women ambled about the narrow street, some wrapped in large puffy jackets, some barely wearing a sweatshirt, many of them eyeing the unrecognized truck as it drove by. 

"Listen, I'm sure you already got the third degree from her about Wispy-"

"Yeah, what is the deal about that?" Victor shrugged and continued to watch the curious passerby's through the window. 

"Don't ask me, it's just the way she is I guess. I couldn't care less what you guys do, but Carla's different. She's going to skewer you if this goes south." Mouse rolled his eyes. 

"Is that it, up there?" Mouse nodded towards the oversized SUV near the end of the street, its polished chrome reflecting the afternoon sun right into their eyes.

"Yeah, let's not get to close though, ok."

"Won't need too." Mouse said as he slowed down and began fumbling with the cables bundled up next to him. He jammed a USB port into the cigarette lighter and the small screen on the tiny computer lit up, white text began scrolling by rapidly. Then, he picked up the keyboard and handed it to Victor.

"Login with this. Username admin, password admin," he said, still watching the road as he crept towards the SUV. After he heard the enter key strike for a second time, he continued, "Ok, now type period, forward-slash, scan, and the tab key. Then hit enter. Great!" He said as he grabbed the small screen and balanced it on the dash. Victor watched as wifi names began ticking by slowly with seemingly random code words next to them.

"What it doing?" 

"Nothing much, it's scanning all the available networks near us, ranking them by security, and then starting with the open ones and working its way down doing a network sweep on each."

"You can find Aige that way?"

"Yep. Wifi devices report what they are to the network. When I looked at my router logs, from when Aige connected the first time, he generated his own signature, so it's safe to assume he's still using that one. When the script finds it, it'll start pinging him the same packet over and over again with details on how to contact me."

"So, did it find him yet?"
