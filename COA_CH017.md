Bob's idea had worked after all.

After a few moments of the system running, they did a clean shutdown, allowing time for all any for the AI to commit any important information it wanted to keep to disk prior to it losing the power. Dr. Kelley now reviewed the answers, including a much cleaner algorithm and one word on the last line: yes.

"Alright then, everything seems satisfactory. All networks are off line. Let's power it up and see how this goes." Bob nodded, and flipped the switch. The hum returned to the wall across from them, and after a moment, Dr. Kelly spoke in a commanding voice towards it, "Hello, AI-65, can you hear me?"

"Yes."
