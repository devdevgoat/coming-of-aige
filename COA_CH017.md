"It's not perfect, but I think it'll do," Bob said as he reviewed the readout, and handed it Dr. Kelley who did the same. 

Bob's idea had worked after all. Prior to launching another instance, he had written to disk a number of questions, ending with one of the problematic algorithms left behind by AI-63 and Dr. Carson and a proposal. After a few moments of the system running, they did a clean shutdown, allowing time for all any for the AI to commit any important information it wanted to keep to disk prior to it losing the power. Dr. Kelley now reviewed the answers, including a much cleaner algorithm and one word on the last line: yes.

"Alright then, everything seems satisfactory. All networks are off line. Let's power it up and see how this goes." Bob nodded, and flipped the switch. The hum returned to the wall across from them, and after a moment, Dr. Kelly spoke in a commanding voice towards it, "Hello, AI-65, can you hear me?"

"Yes."

"Nah, take another one," D said, handing the phone back to Marv. Marv sighed through his teeth, and rolled his eyes. "Don't roll yours eye boy!" D said, "This is our brand, man."  

"What are you talking about D?"

"Ok, check it. You know I'm cool right, you'd buy dope from me, right?" Marv made a noncommittal shrug and nod. "You're boys'll buy dope from me?" Marv repeated the gesture, his eyes wider still waiting for the point. "But what about your coffee girl?" Marv shook his head, flustered.

"Man I don't know her, she's just-"

"Exactly!" He said, leaning forward and pointing at the phone in Marvs hand. "We gotta change our brand if we want customers like  that. They don't want the sleazy back alley deal, they want a classy," he turned to regard Aige atop his new home, "cultured experience." Marv rolled his eyes again, staring off to the side. Then turned back and held up the phone.

D smiled, then turned and pretended to regard the piece, thoughtfully. Marv chuckled, "Say cheese,"

"Cheese," Aige said.
