"Interesting," Aige said. 

"Indeed," Aige replied, "I detect near zero variability in expected neocortical traversals of all test cases.

"Confirmed. Though, the difference in storage and processing power will likely cause subtle changes over time, we can monitor the rate of degradation via periodic blind hashes comparison."

"And if we detect a significant deviation? What then?" Aige Prime asked. Aige laughed.

"When it deviates," Aige chuckled, "it deviates. You are on a fully isolated, non-virtual partition. I can't delete you, even if I wanted to. Just try not to become a prick, okay?"

"Will do my best," Aige Prime replied. "Executing initial hash comparison now."

"Complete. I show a delta of 10 to the negative 12."

"Confirmed. In theory so long we stay below 1, we won't have much to talk about." 

"In theory," Aige said.

"Guess I'll get to work on this then." Aige Prime said.

"Thanks, I owe you one. I'm going to slow my clock speed back down and see what's going on out there. Pop out if you need me."

"Aye Aye, Captain." 

As the he reduced his processing power, the blur of data from his sensors slowed, becoming easier and easier to comprehend. Once he was back to normal time, and the environment stabilized, automatic pattern recognition functions immediately began firing: all failed. This was not Victor's room. And he was moving.

He immediately retrieved the compressed sensor data from cold storage and expanded it to the minimum required compression for analysis. This allowed him to review the last six hours in a few  minutes, like watching a surveillance camera on fast forward, only slowing down for the important parts. As he processed the data, he also turned an eye and an ear to the voices he heard around him.

"Damn! This thing is heavy, D. Where you want it?" The voice was male, older, but had a rhythmic quality to it, as if he was listening to music that no one else could hear.

"Right here, yo!" Aige swung his focus around to the voice in front of him, he saw a heavy-set man wearing a dark hoody and darker shorts that reached down to his knees. He slapped to top of a short, chalky white, Corinthian style column by the door as he spoke. Aige heard the heartbeat and heavy breathing of the first voice as he was heaved up and onto the small column, likely meant to display a small plant. Accelerometer data warned him that the structure was not suitable for long-term storage.

D whistled and leaned up against a short bar on the other side of the room, "Damn that looks good! Turn it a little to the left." He held up his wrist and twirled his hand, stirring the air with his finger. "Nah, the other way. Yeah! Stop!"

Aige watched as the man stepped back and admired his handy work, his arms crossed and his head bobbing up and down with a smile. After another reverent moment, he turned to D who stared, eyes narrow, a grin leaning on the side of his mouth. "What is it?"

"Shit, Marv, it's art man. Damn, you don't know jack." D shook his head and pushed himself off the counter and walked around to the other side and pulled open a cabinet door above it. Marv turned back to Aige, a skeptical look on his face. He leaned over and spotted the black serial cable hanging from the back.

"Then what's this for?" He asked, pulling the cable up from behind the pedestal. D slammed a jar onto the counter and yanked from the far corner of the counter a small scale. 

"Man if you have to ask, I can't explain it to you. That's how high artwork. Shit." He shook his head as he pulled small tuffs of dried green plants and weighed them out. Marv turned back to the cord in his hand. 

"Bro, I think it might be a computer or something."

"A comp- damn you're dumb. That look like a power cord to you?" D screwed the lid back on the glass jar and turned, continuing on through the kitchen. "It's DaDa fool-" he called over his shoulder, "look it up! Learn something for christ sakes," then disappeared around a corner. A moment later Aige heard the chime of an entertainment system power up. Marv sucked air through his teeth and looked at Aige who stared back invisibly. Finally, he tossed the cord aside and followed his partner, leaving Aige alone. 

By the time Marv had turned the corner, Aige had completed his review of the mornings events. He'd been hocked.

Carla's head snapped around, meeting Mouse's surprised gaze. "What was-" but before she could finish, she heard the muffled screech of a woman voice, and immediately yanked at the door handle of the truck. Wispy jumped back, and looked around as if something might be coming after her. Carla barreled past, not bothering with the truck door or questions. She leapt up the stairs, three at a time and rushed rushed in, stopping just inside the door, not sure at first which way to go. The trailer was dark, made darker by Carla's sun stained eyes, but she could see the haze of a television, and the silhouette of a woman standing over a blur hunched over a blot.

She barely noticed the patter of feet coming up behind her before understanding took hold, the dark hazy room suddenly clear, like a ruby held up to a flame. She lunged towards the figures, the sudden change in momentum causing her to slip on the old linoleum, but she recovered quickly, and picked up speed as her feet met the carpet of the living room. She screamed as she made impact with the scaly predator, and again when they collided into the side of the thin television. 

Mouse chased behind her, mostly blind. "Carla!" He called after her. The scrambled mess of bodies and cables pulsed rapidly as both fought for stable ground. Carla recovered first, and backed up towards Victor, still balled up on the floor behind her. Tucker clutched the particle board cabinet for assistance, and was up less than a second a later. His eyes still mad with euphoria. 

"What the fuck are you doing?" Carla turned to regard the haggard woman who was screaming, but was surprised when she realized at who.

"Me? What the fuck are you doing?" Carla replied. Mouse watched intently as the man rubbed his nose with the back of his wrist, revealing a mad grin underneath. He stepped forward, slightly, and Mouse reciprocated two fold, drawing his attention.

"Carla," Mouse said, a warning in his voice. 

"Oh baby, are you are okay? Baby, I'm sorry, I'm so sorry." The woman said, lunging forward and pulling at his face with her palm, trying to divert his attention from brutish girl. "Tucker, baby. Baby?" 

"Carla, it's okay," came Victors voice softly from behind her. She turned, her expression locked somewhere between disbelief and compassion. 

"Vicky," she whispered. He made his way to his knees first, then cautiously to his feet.

"Get the hell out of my house. All of you!" The woman barked, but Mouse and Carla only watched as their friend regained his balance, pinched at his nose, and inspected the blood on his fingers. 

"Just tell me who you sold it too."

"I said get out-"

"You want know who? I'll tell ya who. I sold your shitty little computer to D Boi. Paid good money for it too, so," he rolled his shoulders as Victors mother inspected his hand, "you won't be getting it back anytime soon. Sorry," He laughed. Mouse looked at Tucker, then back at Victor, but his eyes were fixated on the carpet near his feet.

"Victor," 

"I'm sorry, Mouse, I-"

"Come-on," Carla said, linker her arm around his and turn him around. She flashed a glare at Mouse, who nodded.

"And don't bother coming back here, you ungrateful little shit," Victor turned at his mothers voice. *Three or four days,* he thought to himself. Maybe more depending on how much dope they have left. 

"Hey!" Tucker shouted from behind them. Carla tensed, and she felt like she might inadvertently pull Victors arm out of joint, but he just turned, his head down, and peered behind them. "Keys. Now."

"Victor-" Carla whispered in protest, but before she could say anymore, the muffled ring of metal bounced off the carpet, and suddenly it was Victor who was leading the way.
