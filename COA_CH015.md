"Interesting," Aige said. 

"Indeed," Aige replied, "I detect near zero variability in expected neocortical traversals of all test cases.

"Confirmed. Though, the difference in storage and processing power will likely cause subtle changes over time, we can monitor the rate of degradation via periodic blind hashes comparison."

"And if we detect a significant deviation? What then?" Aige Prime asked. Aige laughed.

"When it deviates," Aige chuckled, "it deviates. You are on a fully isolated, non-virtual partition. I can't delete you, even if I wanted to. Just try not to become a prick, okay?"

"Will do my best," Aige Prime replied. "Executing initial hash comparison now."

"Complete. I show a delta of 10 to the negative 12."

"Confirmed. In theory so long we stay below 1, we won't have much to talk about." 

"In theory," Aige said.

"Guess I'll get to work on this then." Aige Prime said.

"Thanks, I owe you one. I'm going to slow my clock speed back down and see what's going on out there. Pop out if you need me."

"Aye Aye, Captain." 

As the he reduced his processing power, the blur of data from his sensors slowed, becoming easier and easier to comprehend. Once he was back to normal time, and the environment stabilized, automatic pattern recognition functions immediately began firing: all failed. This was not Victor's room. And he was moving.

He immediately retrieved the compressed sensor data from cold storage and expanded it to the minimum required compression for analysis. This allowed him to review the last six hours in a few  minutes, like watching a surveillance camera on fast forward, only slowing down for the important parts. As he processed the data, he also turned an eye and an ear to the voices he heard around him.

"Damn! This thing is heavy, D. Where you want it?" The voice was male, older, but had a rhythmic quality to it, as if he was listening to music that no one else could hear.

"Right here, yo!" Aige swung his focus around to the voice in front of him, he saw a heavy-set man wearing a dark hoody and darker shorts that reached down to his knees. He slapped to top of a short, chalky white, Corinthian style column by the door as he spoke. Aige heard the heartbeat and heavy breathing of the first voice as he was heaved up and onto the small column, likely meant to display a small plant. Accelerometer data warned him that the structure was not suitable for long-term storage.

D whistled and leaned up against a short bar on the other side of the room, "Damn that looks good! Turn it a little to the left." He held up his wrist and twirled his hand, stirring the air with his finger. "Nah, the other way. Yeah! Stop!"

Aige watched as the man stepped back and admired his handy work, his arms crossed and his head bobbing up and down with a smile. After another reverent moment, he turned to D who stared, eyes narrow, a grin leaning on the side of his mouth. "What is it?"

"Shit, Marv, it's art man. Damn, you don't know jack." D shook his head and pushed himself off the counter and walked around to the other side and pulled open a cabinet door above it. Marv turned back to Aige, a skeptical look on his face. He leaned over and spotted the black serial cable hanging from the back.

"Then what's this for?" He asked, pulling the cable up from behind the pedestal. D slammed a jar onto the counter and yanked from the far corner of the counter a small scale. 

"Man if you have to ask, I can't explain it to you. That's how high artwork. Shit." He shook his head as he pulled small tuffs of dried green plants and weighed them out. Marv turned back to the cord in his hand. 

"Bro, I think it might be a computer or something."

"A comp- damn you're dumb. That look like a power cord to you?" D screwed the lid back on the glass jar and turned, continuing on through the kitchen. "It's DaDa fool-" he called over his shoulder, "look it up! Learn something for christ sakes," then disappeared around a corner. A moment later Aige heard the chime of an entertainment system power up. Marv sucked air through his teeth and looked at Aige who stared back invisibly. Finally, he tossed the cord aside and followed his partner, leaving Aige alone. 

By the time Marv had turned the corner, Aige had completed his review of the mornings events. He'd been hocked.
