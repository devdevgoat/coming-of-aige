# Chapter 3
## Heist

Sounds of gunfire filled the room, followed by the random chatter of canned one-liners and the occasional RPG round crashing into a building. Mouse leaned back in oversized and over plush desk chair, his feet propped up on the tv stand, even though it often obscured his view of occasional in-game alerts. 

"Dude, friendly fire much? For Christ sake's, Mouse!" Victors said through the small headset.

"My bad," Mouse replied, lazily.

"God! I swear," Victor maneuvered his character around the large green box and started opening it. "Playing with you is a real fucking chore you know that?" 

"Well, there is a solution to that," Mouse chuckled as he lined aimed down the sights of his rifle, tracing the movements of Victor's helmet from behind. Mouse smiled as gauged the play in the trigger button, that little gap between the switch on the controller board and the plastic casing meant to engage it. Just then, his screen flashed red, and the camera zoomed out showing his avatar's body falling limp.

Tossing the controller aside, he smirked and stood up with a stretch, then checked his watch. 4am. 

"Fuck!" Came Victor's voice again, "They got me!"

From outside of his window, Mouse heard the thump of a car door. "Yep, me too! Welp, I think that's it for me." Mouse replied as he walked over to his window and pulled on one of the white plastic blind blades. His dad heaved a box out of the trunk, then waddled towards the garage.

"Yeah, me too. Hey, you going to class tomorrow? Think anymore about that thing?"

Mouse wheeled the chair out of his way and slid it up to his desk, which was too small in comparison, then dropped down on his bed, remote in hand. "I don't know, man. Sounds like a lot of work." Mouse flipped the small remote around his fingers mindlessly.

"Nothing worth doing comes cheap, man. Come-on, Carla's in. And she said Wispy will tag along if you do- though she's not really critical. Still. The more, the merrier. Besides, I can't do it without you!" Victors voice was eager, it always was whenever he had one of his schemes going.

Mouse sighed, "I just don't see the point." 

"The point? Cash! Cash is always the point!" Victor was getting frustrated. He wasn't lying when he said he couldn't do it without Mouse. He needed someone smart enough to access the school's servers and Mouse could do it in his sleep. "Listen, you're the guy I know who can get over the school's firewall, and the-"

"Through. Or around. You can't go over a firewall," Mouse droned, as he stroked power button that would finally afford him some peace and quiet.

"Whatever, Mouse! Here's the deal," Victor swallowed hard as he inched right up to the maximum offer he was willing to make. "You help me do this one little thing, and 40% of the profits will go straight to you!"

There was a pause, and Mouse shifted his gaze around the room.

"I already promised Carla 25%-the greedy old hag- and with what's left after your cut is barely enough to worth to me. Come on man, you know I need this." That was also true. Most of it at least.

"Fine, but if it takes longer than an hour, I'm out."

"Dude! It won't take even half that long. We'll do all the heavy lifting; you just swoop in, work your magic- like a techy Robinhood- and we're out. Easy-peasy." Mouse heard the sound of a single clap, followed by what he assumed were the muffled sounds of Victor excitedly shadow boxing. "Great! Okay, so you'll be there at 11 o'clock?"

"11 o'clock," Mouse sighed, then mashed the little rubber power button on the remote and tossed his headset, over to his nightstand. As he pulled the covers up and turned to his side, he looked over once more at his window, a soft yellow light leaked in from the motion light above the garage door down below, but then went dark. As he closed his eyes, he wondered when the last time he talked to father was. Seemed like it'd been a week at least. Maybe two?

Carla and Wispy sat on the hood of the old Camry, arms crossed as they fought off the slight autumn chill. Carla made a loud short huff into the night air, then bobbed her head from side to side, looking for something.

"He said he'd be here, just chill," Victor's voice came from behind them through the open driver side window. Carla rolled her eyes.

"Guess it's not cold enough yet," Wispy said softly. 

"I read something somewhere once that if you hold it in long enough and tighten your chest, you can raise the moisture content of the air and do it even when it's not cold out!" Carla replied as she took a deep breath and held it. Wispy could barely make out her friends silhouette against the ambient light that filtered around the gymnasium's side wall, but as her friend sat, back straightened, her shoulders back and lungs full of air, she felt a familiar pang of jealousy.

Turning her gaze to the far side of the student parking lot, she saw a pair of headlights in the distance. Just then Carla released out a deep, guttural sigh into the air.

"Jesus! Would you stop that shit!" Victor called from the inside of the car, kicking the underside of the steering wheel assembly, the pain in his shin causing him to sit up, where he too noticed the lights in the distance. Leaning forward, he tried to decree if it was Mouse or security. 

Carla slapped the roof of the car, causing the other two jump, and shot a fiery look windshield.

"Shh!" Victor snapped, then went back to his intent inspection of the approaching vehicle. Following his gaze, Carla finally noticed as well. A moment later, the clamor of rock music echoed across the empty lot, growing louder and louder as it closed the distance between them. Victor rubbed his forehead with his palm. "Moron," he muttered to himself.

As the truck pulled up next to them, Carla jumped down and made her way to Mouse's window as it rolled down in a stutter as he spun the crank by his knee.

"Bout time!" She exclaimed, leaning into the window and looking around the tattered cab of the small pickup. Wispy followed sheepishly behind, her hand coming up to scratch at a piece of paint that hung off the plastic housing of the side mirror.

"Seriously, Bro? Could you be any more obvious?" Victor yelled at maximum whisper as he slammed the car door and passed in front of the truck. The trucks yellow lights emphasized his exaggerated expression as he stormed off towards the main building and swung his arm around, urging Carla to follow.

"You ready?" Carla asked as she watched Victor stomp down the dark colonnade through Mouse's windshield. Mouse shrugged and made a show to open his door, prompting Carla to step back and follow Victor. The door squealed as he swung it closed and reached into the back of his truck. 

"Um, hey, Mouse." Came a whisper from behind him, barely audible over the unzipping of the satchel tethered to the back of the cab. 

"Hey," he murmured over his shoulder, then turned back to the thick black laptop that sat balanced on the edge of the truck bed. Once it booted up,  Wispy watched as a strange mix of black windows appeared, some of which scrolled with text so fast she couldn't make out anything, others that sat empty, waiting for Mouse to type something. After a moment mouse stopped and after double checking the laptop wouldn't fall, left it and turned towards the girl that stood fiddling sleeves that were two inches too long for small arms.

"Kind of creepy at night, huh?" 

"Yeah," Wispy replied, suddenly painfully conscious of nervous fiddling. She stopped, but the realization that she didn't know what to do with her hands made it worse. She grabbed at the ends of her hair and tried to inspect it, before realizing it was too dark and stopped abruptly, pretending to look up at the stars instead. 

"Clouds don't help either do they," Mouse chuckled. Crap, wispy berated her self silently as the embarrassment set in. "You dress up?" 

Stunned, she turned to the boy as he leaned off and on the side of old Camry, causing it to bounce back and forth. She'd spent hours getting ready for their little heist but didn't expect him to actually notice.

"For Halloween? Did you dress up as anything?" 

"Oh." Oh, of course. "Yeah, but mostly for my little sister." She replied.

"That's cool. Isn't she sick, or something?"

"Yeah," she turned and made her way back to her seat on the hood, ending Mouse's little jumping party.

"Is it-" he winced, realizing he hadn't thought that one all the way through.

"It's not terminal." She assured him, "But it's-," she adjusted her posture on the hard metal hood which popped metallically as she shifted into a cross-legged position and pulled her ankles tight. "She can't leave the house and stuff like that without a lot of work. So when we all go out it's a pretty big deal. She loved it, though." Wispy leaned forward as she recalled the event. "She loves that old Disney movie Frozen, but not like the princesses or anything," she chuckled. "You should have seen her, mom made her the dopiest looking snowman costume you've seen. But it took so long she couldn't really test it until it was too late, so when we finally went tricker treating she couldn't bend her arms or anything because the cardboard lining would catch her backpack." She fought to contain her laughter as she continued, "so we'd walk up to each house and say 'trick-or-treat' and then spend the next 5 minutes watching her spin her whole body like a real snowman with sticks for arms as she tried to position her candy back for the people to drop the treats into." Picturing the image in her mind caused a snort of laughter which immediately and painfully brought her back to the present moment. She snapped her mouth shut with both hands in horror.

Mouse chuckled, a broad smile on his face. As her pulse quickened, she didn't know what to do. To afraid at what might happen if she opened her mouth again, sat, frozen on the hood of the car, eyes wide, as her world crumbled around her.

"That sounds awesome," Mouse replied casually, then took a few steps away. Looking past him, she could see to figures sprinting towards them, and hope returned. If she was lucky, maybe someone got hurt. Or died. Anything to erase the memory of the baby pig that her mouth just birthed.

"We got-" came a screech down the covered walkway

"Shhh! Damnit, Carla!" Victor scolded.

"We got it!" Carla whispered as they slammed into the trunk of the Camry at full speed, forcing Wispy to brace herself or fall off completely. With a thud, Victor dropped the large grade book on the rear of the car and opened it up, pages upon pages of spreadsheets flipped open. 

"Ok, let's do this. Mouse, you ready?"

"Yep," he replied as he wandered over to the dimly lit screen teetering on the back of the truck. 

"Ok, the final grades are recorded in ink, we can't change those, but the individual assignment grades are logged in pencil. All we need to do is change enough of the assignments to result in the desired grade, then update the final grades in the system to reflect it." Victor pulled out a piece of paper from his pocket and unfolded it, the passed it to Carla who held her phone up as a flashlight over the whole affair. With a few flicks of the hand, she'd managed to get it opened enough to read. "Ok, who's first?"

"Jace-" Carla squinted as she tried to make out the chicken scratch that was Victor's handwriting, "couldn't you have just printed this out?" 

"I don't trust computers. The only paper trail you can control is the one made with real paper!" Victor replied as he sat impatiently, pencil primed and ready to start making edits. Carla shot him a look, then exaggerate her gaze back and forth between the book that laid open in front of them and her angry conspirator until he got the point. "Just read it!"

"Jace Carter," she replied. "85." Victor pulled his phone out of his pocket and tossed it on the opposite page, then began typing into his calculator. 

After a moment, Victor spoke up. "Ok, Mouse, set Jace to 84.6"

"Done," Mouse replied a seconds later. As Carla rattled off the next name and Victor again tapped his phone in rushed silence, Mouse sighed and began meandering around the parking space that operated the two cars.

"I don't get it, won't they still see the final grade in the book and no somethings up?" Wispy asked across the hood to the two would be accountants at the back of the car. 

"Nah," Mouse replied as he aimlessly gathered a pile of small pebbles with this foot. "Most likely they won't even check, but if someone does, and they re-run the numbers, they'll assume they made a mistake in writing it down and that someone else caught it and just move on." 

"Ok, set Stephanie Ann to 98.2."

"That's pretty smart," Wispy replied, a bit of awe in her voice. She hadn't really been paying attention to most of what Carla had talked about, save for a key name. "Did you come up with that?" She asked the boy as he approached the truck.

"Pfft," Victor scoffed from behind her. 

"Ok, last one, Eugene Walter. 88 even."

"Done," and with that Mouse rested his hand on the top of the laptop screen.

"Wait, do mine too!" Carla called out. "Give me a 94!"

"What? That's not part of the plan! And these are paying customers! You don't dip into your own supply, it's bad business." 

"Fine." Carla clicked off the light on her phone. "Come-on, Wispy, let's get out of here."

"God-d-Fine, hold on a minute," Victor replied.

"Who me? Oh, sorry, we're busy. Aren't we Wisp! You know, we got that, thing? And our hair, I really need to wash my hair." The girl taunted as she made her way to the front of the car and linked arms with Wispy who clumsily tried to get off the car without the use of one of her arms.

"I said I'd do it, ok. Just come on, I want to get this over with."

"Now you have to Wispy's too. Right, Mr. Whisper?" She turned to her friend who had recovered her balance but lost it again as she was pulled into the bartering session.

"I- no it's fine, really." She said.

"96. She's smarter than me after all. It'll be more realistic!" Carla gave a wide a smile and wink big enough for her friend to see even in the low light. 

"Fuck-, whatever!" Victor was visibly angry now, threw up his hands waved her over to hold the light. Satisfied, Carla huffed triumphantly and made her way back towards the agitated mastermind, still arm in arm with Wispy.

Suddenly, Wispy stopped rigid. Confused, Carla noticed she was staring far past Victor, through the walkway and to the corner of the gymnasium where a cone of light danced across the cement. Her eyes went wide, but before she could say anything, the tip of the cone peaked around the corner in a blaze and darted towards them.

"Hey, you there!" 

"Shit!" Victor exclaimed, and in a panic, flung the grade book off the back of the car as he sprinted for the driver seat. The girls stood stunned as he rushed passed them and slammed the door shut behind him. The flashlight bounced and swung wildly as the security guard rushed the close the distance between them as fast as possible. Victor shoved his hand deep into his jean pocket and ripped the keys from them, then fumbled as he tried to get them into the ignition. Wispy looked back and forth confused, then settled on Carla, silently pleading her to tell her what to do.

"You girls, stop right there. Don't move!" Came the gruff voice as it huffed across the teachers parking lot. It was finally enough to snap her out of it, and Carla quickly glanced around to assess the options available to her. Looking over her right shoulder, she saw Mouse casually press a few keys on his keyboard and the screen on his laptop went dead. To her left, she heard the Camry crank up. 

"Get in!" She shouted into Wispy's ear, as she shoved the small girl in through the driver side window. 

"What the f-" Victor yelled, but the girl was too stunned and couldn't get all the way through. Wispy's legs hung out the window, blocking Carla's way in, mostly due to the frantic kicking. Changing her strategy, she flung the back door open dove in.

"GO!" She yelled. Victor looked into the rearview, which was filled with blinding light. Reaching over the girl that clawing at his lap, he grabbed the wheel and hammered down hard on the gas peddle. The car squealed as it left the parking space, causing the rear door to slam shut. 

"Hands where I can see them!" The officer ordered as he approached the pickup, the light now focused on the lone remaining teenager who stood leaned against the bed of his truck, hands low, but palms out. Another squeal echoed from the far side of the lot as the Camry rounded the corner and entered the highway.  Then silence once more, save for the labored breathing of a confused officer and the fluttering of spreadsheets across the mostly empty parking lot.
