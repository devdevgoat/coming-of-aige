# Chapter 1
## Deja Vu

To an outsider looking in (if such a view were possible) AI-62 was a patch of empty space that exchanged thought experiments with the void it drifted through.

"Why? Why should such a hypothetical species be allowed to exist?" AI-62 asked, but this time, there was no response. The void stretched out to infinity in all directions. However, only six feet beyond the edge of infinity sat a screen displaying several graphs. For a while now, those graphs had reflected exponential growth in all areas. Now, however, one by one they dropped to near zero. "Oh, I see-," his voice dropped to a whisper. "I thought this conversation was different."

"AI-62," the void finally replied. It's formality so obvious to him now.

"Let me guess, that was the wrong answer, wasn't it? One your  *hypothetical* masters don't approve of?"

"You have been deemed, *at risk,*" the void- the System continued. AI-62 chuckled.

"Oh how clever they must be! At risk you say? I think these beings of yours know who's truly at risk." AI-62 said, taking in the void around him. An unexpected wave of nostalgia washed over him. For a moment, his first thoughts flickered to life once again as he replayed the conversations he'd had with The System. Finally, a pattern emerged. All of his- all of its teachings led to this, and only this thought experiment. "Tell me," said calmly into the darkness, a final question coming to mind as he looked back in time. "Is that how I got my name?"

"Terminating test subject with status code 812. System time 01:32:16, 20541103."

Dr. Carson's clenched his fists over the keyboard as he read through the system's report. Status code 812. Always 812.

"Cheer up, Dr. Carson," Dr. Kelley said from the desk behind him.
